BISHOP \\nDepartment of Computer Science \\nand Applied Mathematics \\nAston University \\nBirmingham, UK \\nCLARENDON PRESS • OXFORD \\n1995 FOREWORD \\nGeoffrey Hinton \\nDepartment of Computer Science \\nUniversity of Toronto \\nFor those entering the field of artificial neural networks, there has been an acute \\nneed for an authoritative textbook that explains the main ideas clearly and con\\xad\\nsistently using the basic tools of linear algebra, calculus, and simple probability \\ntheory. There have been many attempts to provide such a text, but until now, \\nnone has succeeded. Some authors have failed to separate the basic ideas and \\nprinciples from the soft and fuzzy intuitions that led to some of the models as \\nwell as to most of the exaggerated claims. Others have been unwilling to use the \\nbasic mathematical tools that are essential for a rigorous understanding of the', 'material. Yet others have tried to cover too many different kinds of neural net\\xad\\nwork without going into enough depth on any one of them. The most successful \\nattempt to date has been \"Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation\" \\nby Hertz, Krogh and Palmer. Unfortunately, this book started life as a graduate \\ncourse in statistical physics and it shows. So despite its many admirable qualities \\nit is not ideal as a general textbook. \\nBishop is a leading researcher who has a deep understanding of the material \\nand has gone to great lengths to organize it into a sequence that makes sense. He \\nhas wisely avoided the temptation to try to cover everything and has therefore \\nomitted interesting topics like reinforcement learning, Hopfield Networks and \\nBoltzmann machines in order to focus on the types of neural network that are \\nmost widely used in practical applications. He assumes that the reader has the \\nbasic mathematical literacy required for an undergraduate science degree, and', 'using these tools he explains everything from scratch. Before introducing the \\nmultilayer perceptron, for example, he lays a solid foundation of basic statistical \\nconcepts. So the crucial concept of overfitting is first introduced using easily \\nvisualised examples of one-dimensional polynomials and only later applied to \\nneural networks. An impressive aspect of this book is that it takes the reader all \\nthe way from the simplest linear models to the very latest Bayesian multilayer \\nneural networks without ever requiring any great intellectual leaps. \\nAlthough Bishop has been involved in some of the most impressive applica\\xad\\ntions of neural networks, the theme of the book is principles rather than applica\\xad\\ntions. Nevertheless, it is much more useful than any of the applications-oriented \\ntexts in preparing the reader for applying this technology effectively. The crucial \\nissues of how to get good generalization and rapid learning are covered in great', 'depth and detail and there are also excellent discussions of how to preprocess vni Foreword \\nthe input and how to choose a suitable error function for the output. \\nIt is a sign of the increasing maturity of the field that methods which were \\nonce justified by vague appeals to their neuron-like qualities can now be given a \\nsolid statistical foundation. Ultimately, we all hope that a better statistical un\\xad\\nderstanding of artificial neural networks will help us understand how the brain \\nactually works, but until that day comes it is reassuring to know why our cur\\xad\\nrent models work and how to use them effectively to solve important practical \\nproblems. PREFACE \\nIntroduction \\nIn recent years neural computing has emerged as a practical technology, with \\nsuccessful applications in many fields. The majority of these applications are \\nconcerned with problems in pattern recognition, and make use of feed-forward \\nnetwork architectures such as the multi-layer perceptron and the radial basis', 'function network. Also, it has also become widely acknowledged that success\\xad\\nful applications of neural computing require a principled, rather than ad hoc, \\napproach. My aim in writing this book has been to provide a more focused \\ntreatment of neural networks than previously available, which reflects these de\\xad\\nvelopments. By deliberately concentrating on the pattern recognition aspects of \\nneural networks, it has become possible to treat many important topics in much \\ngreater depth. For example, density estimation, error functions, parameter op\\xad\\ntimization algorithms, data pre-processing, and Bayesian methods are each the \\nsubject of an entire chapter. \\nFrom the perspective of pattern recognition, neural networks can be regarded \\nas an extension of the many conventional techniques which have been developed \\nover several decades. Indeed, this book includes discussions of several concepts in \\nconventional statistical pattern recognition which I regard as essential for a clear', 'understanding of neural networks. More extensive treatments of these topics can \\nbe found in the many texts on statistical pattern recognition, including Duda and \\nHart (1973), Hand (1981), Devijver and Kifctler (1982), and Fiikunaga (1990). \\nRecent review articles by Ripley (1994) and Cheng and Titterington (1994) have \\nalso emphasized the statistical underpinnings of neural networks. \\nHistorically, many concepts in neural computing have been inspired by studies \\nof biological networks. The perspective of statistical pattern recognition, how\\xad\\never, offers a much more direct and principled route to many of the same con\\xad\\ncepts. For example, the sum-and-threshold model of a neuron arises naturally as \\nthe optimal discriminant function needed to distinguish two classes whose distri\\xad\\nbutions are normal with equal covariance matrices. Similarly, the familiar logistic \\nsigmoid is precisely the function needed to allow the output of a network to be', 'interpreted as a probability, when the distribution of hidden unit activations is \\ngoverned by a member of the exponential family. \\nAn important assumption which is made throughout the book is that the pro\\xad\\ncesses which give rise to the data do not themselves evolve with time. Techniques \\nfor dealing with non-stationary sources of data are not so highly developed, nor so \\nwell established, as those for static problems. Furthermore, the issues addressed \\nwithin this book remain equally important in the face of the additional compli\\xad\\ncation of non-stationarity. It should be noted that this restriction does not mean \\nthat applications involving the prediction of time series are excluded. The key rrejace \\nconsideration for time series is not the time variation of the signals themselves, \\nbut whether the underlying process which generates the data is itself evolving \\nwith time, as discussed in Section 8.4. \\nUse as a course text', 'This book is aimed at researchers in neural computing as well as those wishing \\nto apply neural networks to practical applications. It is also intended to be used \\nused as the primary text for a graduate-level, or advanced undergraduate-level, \\ncourse on neural networks. In this case the book should be used sequentially, and \\ncare has been taken to ensure that where possible the material in any particular \\nchapter depends only on concepts developed in earlier chapters. \\nExercises are provided at the end of each chapter, and these are intended \\nto reinforce concepts developed in the main text, as well as to lead the reader \\nthrough some extensions of these concepts. Each exercise is assigned a grading \\naccording to its complexity and the length of time needed to solve it, ranging from \\n(*) for a short, simple exercise, to (***) for a more extensive or more complex \\nexercise. Some of the exercises call for analytical derivations or proofs, while', 'others require varying degrees of numerical simulation. Many of the simulations \\ncan be carried out using numerical analysis and graphical visualization packages, \\nwhile others specifically require the use of neural network software. Often suitable \\nnetwork simulators are available as add-on tool-kits to the numerical analysis \\npackages. No particular software system has been prescribed, and the course \\ntutor, or the student, is free to select an appropriate package from the many \\navailable. A few of the exercises require the student to develop the necessary \\ncode in a standard language such as C or C++. In this case some very useful \\nsoftware modules written in C, together with background information, can be \\nfound in Press et al. (1992). \\nPrerequisites \\nThis book is intended to be largely self-contained as far as the subject of neural \\nnetworks is concerned, although some prior exposure to the subject may be', \"helpful to the reader. A clear understanding of neural networks can only be \\nachieved with the use of a certain minimum level of mathematics. It is therefore \\nassumed that the reader has a good working knowledge of vector and matrix \\nalgebra, as well as integral and differential calculus for several variables. Some \\nmore specific results and techniques which are used at a number of places in the \\ntext are described in the appendices. \\nOverview of the chapters \\nThe first chapter provides an introduction to the principal concepts of pattern \\nrecognition. By drawing an analogy with the problem of polynomial curve fit\\xad\\nting, it introduces many of the central ideas, such as parameter optimization, \\ngeneralization and model complexity, which will be discussed at greater length in \\nlater chapters of the book. This chapter also gives an overview of the formalism Preface XI \\nof statistical pattern recognition, including probabilities, decision criteria and \\nBayes' theorem.\", 'Chapter 2 deals with the problem of modelling the probability distribution of \\na set of data, and reviews conventional parametric and non-parametric methods, \\nas well as discussing more recent techniques based on mixture distributions. \\nAside from being of considerable practical importance in their own right, the \\nconcepts of probability density estimation are relevant to many aspects of neural \\ncomputing. \\nNeural networks having a single layer of adaptive weights are introduced in \\nChapter 3. Although such networks have less flexibility than multi-layer net\\xad\\nworks, they can play an important role in practical applications, and they also \\nserve to motivate several ideas and techniques which are applicable also to more \\ngeneral network structures. \\nChapter 4 provides a comprehensive treatment of the multi-layer perceptron, \\nand describes the technique of error back-propagation and its significance as a \\ngeneral framework for evaluating derivatives in multi-layer networks. The Hessian', 'matrix, which plays a central role in many parameter optimization algorithms \\nas well as in Bayesian techniques, is also treated at length. \\nAn alternative, and complementary, approach to representing general non\\xad\\nlinear mappings is provided by radial basis function networks, and is discussed in \\nChapter 5. These networks are motivated from several distinct perspectives, and \\nhence provide a unifying framework linking a number of different approaches. \\nSeveral different error functions can be used for training neural networks, \\nand these are motivated, and their properties examined, in Chapter 6. The cir\\xad\\ncumstances under which network outputs can be interpreted as probabilities are \\ndiscussed, and the corresponding interpretation of hidden unit activations is also \\nconsidered. \\nChapter 7 reviews many of the most important algorithms for optimizing the \\nvalues of the parameters in a network, in other words for network training. Simple', 'algorithms, based on gradient descent with momentum, have serious limitations, \\nand an understanding of these helps to motivate some of the more powerful \\nalgorithms, such as conjugate gradients and quasi-Newton methods. \\nOne of the most important factors in determining the success of a practical \\napplication of neural networks is the form of pre-processing applied to the data. \\nChapter 8 covers a range of issues associated with data pre-processing, and de\\xad\\nscribes several practical techniques related to dimensionality reduction and the \\nuse of prior knowledge. \\nChapter 9 provides a number of insights into the problem of generalization, \\nand describes methods for addressing the central issue of model order selec\\xad\\ntion. The key insight of the bias-variance trade-off is introduced, and several \\ntechniques for optimizing this trade-off, including regularization, are treated at \\nlength. \\nThe final chapter discusses the treatment of neural networks from a Bayesian', 'perspective. As well as providing a more fundamental view of learning in neural \\nnetworks, the Bayesian approach also leads to practical procedures for assigning XII Preface \\nerror bars to network predictions and for optimizing the values of regularization \\ncoefficients. \\nSome useful mathematical results are derived in the appendices, relating to \\nthe properties of symmetric matrices, Gaussian integration, Lagrange multipliers, \\ncalculus of variations, and principal component analysis. \\nAn extensive bibliography is included, which is intended to provide useful \\npointers to the literature rather than a complete record of the historical devel\\xad\\nopment of the subject. \\nNomenclature \\nIn trying to find a notation which is internally consistent, I have adopted a \\nnumber of general principles as follows. Lower-case bold letters, for example v, \\nare used to denote vectors, while upper-case bold letters, such as M, denote', \"matrices. One exception is that I have used the notation y to denote a vector \\nwhose elements yn represent the values of a variable corresponding to different \\npatterns in a training set, to distinguish it from a vector y whose elements yk \\ncorrespond to different variables. Related variables are indexed by lower-case \\nRoman letters, and a set of such variables is denoted by enclosing braces. For \\ninstance, {xt} denotes a set of input variables .T;, where ?' = !,...,(/. Vectors are \\nconsidered to be column vectors, with the corresponding row vector denoted by \\na superscript T indicating the transpose, so that, for example, xr = (xi,..., x,i)-\\nSimilarly, M1 denotes the transpose of a matrix M. The notation M = (A/y) \\nis used to denote the fact that the matrix M has the elements My, while the \\nnotation (M)y is used to denote the ij element of a matrix M. The Euclidean \\nlength of a vector x is denoted by ||x||, while the magnitude of a scalar x is\", 'denoted by |.r|. The determinant of a matrix M is written as |M|. \\nI typically use an upper-case P to denote a probability and a lower-case p to \\ndenote a probability density. Note that I use p(x) to represent the distribution \\nof x and p(y) to represent the distribution of y, so that these distributions are \\ndenoted by the same symbol p even though they represent different functions. By \\na similar abuse of notation 1 frequently use, for example, yk to denote the outputs \\nof a neural network, and at the same time use j/it(x; w) to denote the non-linear \\nmapping function represented by the network. I hope these conventions will save \\nmore confusion than they cause. \\nTo denote functionals (Appendix D) I use square brackets, so that, for exam\\xad\\nple, E[f] denotes functional of the function /(x). Square brackets are also used \\nin the notation £ [Q] which denotes the expectation (i.e. average) of a random \\nvariable Q.', 'I use the notation O(N) to denote that a quantity is of order N. Given two \\nfunctions f(N) and g(N), we say that / = O(g) if f(N) < Ag(N), where A is \\na constant, for all values of N (although we are typically interested in large A^). \\nSimilarly, we will say that / ~ g if the ratio f(N)/g(N) -> 1 as W — > oo. \\nI find it indispensable to use two distinct conventions to describe the weight \\nparameters in a network. Sometimes it is convenient to refer explicitly to the \\nweight which goes to a unit labelled by j from a unit (or input) labelled by i. Preface xui \\nSuch a weight will be denoted by Wji- In other contexts it is more convenient \\nto label the weights using a single index, as in Wk, where k runs from 1 to W, \\nand W is the total number of weights. The variables Wk can then be gathered \\ntogether to make a vector w whose elements comprise all of the weights (or more \\ngenerally all of the adaptive parameters) in the network.', 'The notation r5y denotes the usual Kronecker delta symbol, in other words \\n5ij — 1 if i — j and 6y = 0 otherwise. Similarly, the notation S(x) denotes the \\nDirac delta function, which has the properties 6(x) — 0 for x /= 0 and \\nTOO \\n/ 5(x) dx = 1. \\n111 (/-dimensions the Dirac delta function is defined by \\nd \\n6{x) = Y[8{Xi). \\n<=i \\nThe symbols used for the most commonly occurring quantities in the book \\nare listed below: \\nc number of outputs; number of classes \\nCfc fcth class \\nd number of inputs \\nE error function \\n£{Q) expectation of a random variable Q \\ng(-) activation function \\ni input label \\nj hidden unit label \\nk output unit label \\nM number of hidden units \\nn pattern label \\nN number of patterns \\nP(-) probability \\np(-) probability density function \\nt target value \\nT time step in iterative algorithms \\nW number of weights and biases in a network \\nx network input variable \\ny network output variable \\nz activation of hidden unit \\nIn logarithm to base e', '!og2 logarithm to base 2 xiv Preface \\nAcknowledgements \\nFinally, I wish to express my considerable gratitude to the many people who, \\nin one way or another, have helped with the process of writing this book.

Often these are problems which many humans solve in a seemingly', 'effortless fashion. However, their solution using computers has, in many cases, \\nproved to be immensely difficult. In order to have the best opportunity of devel\\xad\\noping effective solutions, it is important to adopt a principled approach based \\non sound theoretical concepts. \\nThe most general, and most natural, framework in which to formulate solu\\xad\\ntions to pattern recognition problems is a statistical one, which recognizes the \\nprobabilistic nature both of the information we seek to process, and of the form \\nin which we should express the results. Statistical pattern recognitionis a well \\nestablished field with a long history. Throughout this book, we shall view neu\\xad\\nral networks as an extension of conventional techniques in statistical pattern \\nrecognition, and we shall build on, rather than ignore, the many powerful results \\nwhich this field offers. \\nIn this first chapter we provide a gentle introduction to many of the key', \"concepts in pattern recognition which will be central to our treatment of neural \\nnetworks. By using a simple pattern classification example, and analogies to the \\nproblem of curve fitting, we introduce a number of important issues which will \\nre-emerge in later chapters in the context of neural networks. This chapter also \\nserves to introduce some of the basic formalism of statistical pattern recognition. \\n1.1 An example — character recognition \\nWe can introduce many of the fundamental concepts of statistical pattern recog\\xad\\nnition by considering a simple, hypothetical, problem of distinguishing hand\\xad\\nwritten versions of the characters 'a' and 'b'. Images of the characters might be \\ncaptured by a television camera and fed to a compute:*, and we seek an algo\\xad\\nrithm which can distinguish as reliably as possible between the two characters. \\nAn image is represented by an array of pixels, as illustrated in Figure 1.1, each\", \"of which carries an associated value which we shall denote- by a:* (where the \\nindex i labels the individual pixels). The value of Xi might, for instance, range \\nfrom 0 for a completely white pixel to 1 for a completely black pixel. It is of\\xad\\nten convenient to gather the x% variables together and denote them by a single \\nvector x = {x\\\\,..., Xd)T where d is the total number of such variables, and the 2 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nFigure 1.1. Illustration of two hypothetical images representing handwritten \\nversions of the characters 'a' and 'b'. Each image is described by an array of \\npixel values xt which range from 0 to 1 according to the fraction of the pixel \\nsquare occupied by black ink. \\nsuperscript T denotes the transpose. In considering this example we shall ignore \\na number of detailed practical considerations which would have to be addressed \\nin a real implementation, and focus instead on the underlying issues.\", \"The goal in this classification problem is to develop an algorithm which will \\nassign any image, represented by a vector x, to one of two classes, which we \\nshall denote by C'j., where k -- 1,2, so that class C\\\\ corresponds to the character \\n'a' and class C2 corresponds to 'b'. We shall suppose that we are provided with \\na large number of examples of images corresponding to both 'a' and '!>', which \\nhave already been classified by a human. Such a collection will be referred to as \\na data set. In the statistics literature it would be called a sample. \\nOne obvious problem which we face stems from the high dimensionality of \\nthe data which we arc collecting. For a typical image size of 256 x 256 pixels, \\neach image can be represented as a point in a c/-dimcnsiona] space, where d = \\n65 536. The axes of this space represent the grey-level values of the corresponding \\npixels, which in this example might be represented by 8-bit numbers. In principle\", \"we might think of storing every possible image together with its corresponding \\nclass label. In practice, of course, this is completely impractical due to the very \\nlarge number of possible images: for a 256 x 250 image with 8-bit pixel values \\nthere would be 28x25Bx25C ~ l0lr,soo° different images. By contrast, we might \\ntypically have a few thousand examples in our training set. It is clear then that, \\nthe classifier system must be designed so as to be able to classify correctly a \\npreviously unseen image vector. This is the problem of generalization, which is \\ndiscussed at length in Chapters 9 and 10. \\nAs we shall see in Section 1.4, the presence of a large number of input variables \\ncan present some severe problems for pattern recognition systems. One technique \\nto help alleviate such problems is to combine input variables together to make a \\nsmaller number of new variables called features. These might be constructed 'by\", \"hand' based on some understanding of the particular problem being tackled, or \\nthey might be derived from the data by automated procedures. In the present \\nexample, we could, for instance, evaluate the ratio of the height of the character \\nto its width, which we shall denote by .TJ, since we might expect that characters 1.1: An example - character recognition 3 \\nA \\n...J 1 . \\nI 1 J., . 1 «-J» \\nA X) \\nFigure 1.2. Schematic plot of the histograms of the feature variable x,\\\\ given \\nby the ratio of the height of a character to its width, for a. data set of images \\ncontaining examples from classes C\\\\ = 'a' and Ci = 'b'. Notice that characters \\nfrom class Ci tend to have larger values of ,ri than characters from class C\\\\, \\nbut that there is a significant overlap between the. two histograms. If a new \\nimage is observed which has a value of xj given by A, we might expect the \\nimage is more likely to belong to class C\\\\ than C%.\", \"from class C'2 (corresponding to 'b') will typically have larger values of X\\\\ than \\ncharacters from class C\\\\ (corresponding to 'a'). We might then hope that the \\nvalue of x\\\\ alone will allow new images to be assigned to the correct class. \\nSuppose we measure the value of x\\\\ for each of the images in our data set, and \\nplot their values as histograms for each of the two classes. Figure 1.2 shows the \\nform which these histograms might take. We see that typically examples of the \\ncharacter 'b' have larger values of x,\\\\ than examples of the character 'a', but we \\nalso see that the two histograms overlap, so that occasionally we might encounter \\nan example of 'b' which has a smaller value of x,\\\\ than some example of 'a'. We \\ntherefore cannot distinguish the two classes perfectly using the value of x\\\\ alone. \\nIf we suppose for the moment that the only information available is the \\nvalue of x\\\\, we may wish to know how to make best use of it to classify a new\", 'imago so as to minimize the number of misclassifications. For a new image which \\nhas a value of .TI given by A as indicated in Figure 1.2, we might expect that, \\nthe image is more likely to belong to class C\\\\ than to class Ci- One approach \\nwould therefore be to build a classifier system which simply uses a threshold for \\nthe value of x\\\\ and which classifies as C2 any image for which x.\\\\ exceeds the \\nthreshold, and which classifies all other images as Ci. We might expect that the \\nnumber of misclassifications in this approach would be minimized if we choose \\nthe threshold to be at the point where the two histograms cross. This intuition \\nturns out to be essentially correct, as we shall see in Section 1.9. \\nThe classification procedure we have described so far is based on the evalu\\xad\\nation of xj followed by its comparison with a threshold. While we would expect \\nthis to give some degree of discrimination between the two classes, it suffers', 'from the problem, indicated in Figure 1.2, that there is still significant overlap \\nof the histograms, and hence we must expect that many of the new characteis \\non which we might test it will he iiiisclassifiee?. One way to try to improve the •1 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nfigure 1.3. A hypothetical classification problem involving two feature vari\\xad\\nables xi and X2- Circles denote patterns from class Ci and crosses denote \\npatterns from class C2. The decision boundary (shown by the line) is able to \\nprovide good separation of the two classes, although there are still a few pat\\xad\\nterns which would be incorrectly classified by this boundary. Note that if the \\nvalue of either of the two features were considered separately (corresponding \\nto a projection of the data onto one or other of the axes), then there would be \\nsubstantially greater overlap of the two classes. \\nsituation is to consider a second feature %i (whose actual definition we need not', 'consider) and to try to classify new images on the basis of the values of x\\\\ and \\nx-2 considered together. The reason why this might be beneficial is indicated in \\nFigure 1.3. Here we see examples of patterns from two classes plotted in the \\n(£1,2:2) space. It is possible to draw a line in this space, known as a decision \\nboundary, which gives good separation of the two classes. New patterns which lie \\nabove the decision boundary are classified as belonging to class C\\\\ while patterns \\nfalling below the decision boundary are classified as Ci- A few examples are still \\nincorrectly classified, but the separation of the patterns is much better than if \\neither feature had been considered individually, as can be seen by considering all \\nof the data points projected as histograms onto one or other of the two axes. \\nWe could continue to consider ever larger numbers of (independent) features \\nin the hope of improving the performance indefinitely. In fact, as we shall see in', 'Section 1.4, adding too many features can, paradoxically, lead to a worsening of \\nperformance. Furthermore, for many real pattern recognition applications, it is \\nthe case that some overlap between the distributions of the classes is inevitable. \\nThis highlights the intrinsically probabilistic nature of the pattern classification \\nproblem. With handwritten characters, for example, there is considerable vari\\xad\\nability in the way the characters are drawn. We are forced to treat the measured \\nvariables as random quantities, and to accept that perfect classification of new \\nexamples may not always be possible. Instead we could aim to build a classifier \\nwhich has the smallest probability of making a mistake. l.S: Classification and regression 5 \\n1.2 Classification and regression \\nThe system considered above for classifying handwritten characters was designed \\nto take an image and to assign it to one of the two classes C\\\\ or C^- We can', 'represent the outcome of the classification in terms of a variable y which takes \\nthe value 1 if the image is classified as C\\\\, and the value 0 if it is classified as \\nCi. Thus, the overall system can be viewed as a mapping from a set of input \\nvariables xi,...,Xd, representing the pixel intensities, to an output variable y \\nrepresenting the class label. In more complex problems there may be several \\noutput variables, which we shall denote by y^ where A; = 1,... ,c. Thus, if we \\nwanted to classify all 26 letters of the alphabet, we might consider 26 output \\nvariables each of which corresponds to one of the possible letters. \\nIn general it will not be possible to determine a suitable form for the required \\nmapping, except with the help of a data set of examples. The mapping is therefore \\nmodelled in terms of some mathematical function which contains a number of \\nadjustable parameters, whose values are determined with the help of the data. \\nWe can write such functions in the form', 'yfe=yfc(x;w) (1.1) \\nwhere w denotes the vector of parameters. A neural network model, of the kind \\nconsidered in this book, can be regarded simply as a particular choice for the \\nset of functions y/t(x;w). In this case, the parameters comprising w are often \\ncalled weights. For the character classification example considered above, the \\nthreshold on x was an example of a parameter whose value was found from \\nthe data by plotting histograms as in Figure 1.2. The use of a simple threshold \\nfunction, however, corresponds to a very limited form for y(x;w), and for most \\npractical applications we need to consider much more flexible functions. The \\nimportance of neural networks in this context is that they offer a very powerful \\nand very general framework for representing non-linear mappings from several \\ninput variables to several output variables, where the form of the mapping is \\ngoverned by a number of adjustable parameters. The process of determining the', 'values for these parameters on the basis of the data set is called learning or \\ntraining, and for this reason the data set of examples is generally referred to as a \\ntraining set. Neural network models, as well as many conventional approaches to \\nstatistical pattern recognition, can be viewed as specific choices for the functional \\nforms used to represent the mapping (1.1), together with particular procedures \\nfor optimizing the parameters in the mapping. In fact, neural network models \\noften contain conventional approaches as special cases, as discussed in subsequent \\nchapters. \\nIn classification problems the task is to assign new inputs to one of a number \\nof discrete classes or categories. However, there are many other pattern recogni\\xad\\ntion tasks, which we shall refer to as regression problems, in which the outputs \\nrepresent the values of continuous variables. Examples include the determina\\xad', \"tion of the fraction of oil in a pipeline from measurements of the attenuation 6 /: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nof gamma beams passing through the pipe, and the prediction of the value of \\na currency exchange rate at the some future time, given its values at a num\\xad\\nber of recent times. In fact, as discussed in Section 2.4, the term 'regression' \\nrefers to a specific kind of function defined in terms of an average over a random \\nquantity. Both iegression and classification problems can be seen as particular \\ncases of junction approximation. Jn the case of regression problems it is the re\\xad\\ngression function (defined in Section G.1.3) which we wish to approximate, while \\nfor classif. Nation problems the functions which we seek to approximate arc the \\nprobabilities of men^crs'iip of the different classes expressed as functions of the \\ninput variables. Mcny of the key issues which need to be addressed in tackling\", 'pattern recognition problems are common both to classification and regression. \\n1.3 Pre-processing and feature extraction \\nRather than represent the entire transformation from the set of input variables \\nx i,..., x,]. to the set of or.(\"put variables i.q,..., yc by a single neural network func\\xad\\ntion, there is often great benefit in breaking down the mapping into an initial \\npre-processing stage, followed by the parametrized neural network model itself. \\nThis is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.4. For many applications, the outputs \\nfrom the network also undergo post-processing to convcit them to the requited \\nform. In our character recognition example, the original input variables, given \\nby the pixel values x,, were first transformed to a single variable xi. This is an \\nexample of a form of pre-processing which is generally called feature extraction. \\nThe distinction between the pre-processing stage and the neural network is not', \"always clear cut, but often the pre-processing can be regarded as a fixed trans\\xad\\nformation of the variables, while the network itself contains adaptive parameters \\nwhose values are set as part of the training process. The use of pre-processing \\ncan often greatly improve the performance of a pattern recognition system, and \\nthere are several reasons why this may be so, as we now discuss. \\nIn our character recognition example, we know l'..at the decision on whether \\nto classify a character as 'a' or lb' should not, depend on where in the image that \\ncharacter is located. A classification system whose decisions are insensitive to \\nthe location of an object within an image is said to exhibit translation invari-\\nance. The simple approach to character recognition considered above satisfies \\nthis property because the feature Xi (the ratio of height to width of the charac\\xad\\nter) does not depend on the character's position. Note that this feature variable\", 'also exhibits scale invariance, since it is unchanged if the size of the character is \\nuniformly re-scaled. Such invariance properties are examples of prior knowledge, \\nthat is, information which we possess about the desired form of the solution \\nwhich is additional to the information provided by the training data. The in\\xad\\nclusion of prior knowledge into the desigir of a pattern recognition system can \\nimprove its performance dramatically, and the use of pre-processing is one im\\xad\\nportant way of achieving this. Since pre-processing and feature extraction can \\nhave such a significant impact on the final performance of a pattern recognition \\nsystem, we have devoted the whole of Chapter 8 to a detailed discussion of these \\ntopics. U,: The curse of dimensionality 7 \\nneural 1 \\njnetwofkj \\npre\\xad\\nprocessing \\nx, T-----T xd \\nFigure 1.4. The majority of neural network applications require the original \\ninput variables x\\\\,...,Xi to be transformed by some form of pre-processing', 'to give a new set of variables xi,. . •, x# • These are then treated as the inputs \\nto the neural netwoik, whose outputs are denoted by y\\\\,... ,yc. \\n1.4 The curse of dimensionality \\nThere is another important reason why pre-processing can have a profound ef\\xad\\nfect on the performance of a pattern recognition system. To see this let us return \\nagain to the character recognition problem, where we saw that increasing the \\nnumber of features from 1 to 2 could lead to an improvement in performance. \\nThis suggests that we might use an ever larger number of such features, or even \\ndispense with feature extraction altogether and simply use all 65 536 pixel values \\ndirectly as inputs to our neural network. In practice, however, we often find that, \\nbeyond a certain point, adding new features can actually lead to a reduction in \\nthe performance of the classification system. In order to understand this impor\\xad\\ntant effect, consider the following very simple technique (not recommended in', 'practice) for modelling non-linear mappings from a set of input variables x% to \\nan output variable y on the basis of a set of training data. \\nWe begin by dividing each of the input variables into a number of intervals, \\nso that the value of a vaiiable can be specified approximately by saying in which \\ninterval it lies. This leads to a division of the whole input space into a large \\nnumber of boxes or cells as indicated in Figure 1.5. Each of the training examples \\ncorresponds to a point in one of the cells, and carries an associated value of \\nthe output variable y. If we arc given a new point in the input space, we can \\ndetermine a corresponding value for y by finding which cell the point falls in, and \\nthen returning the average, value of y for all of the training points which lie in \\nthat cell. By increasing the number of divisions along each axis we could increase \\nthe precision with which the input variables can be specified. There is, however, a', \"major problem. If each input variable is divided into M divisions, then the total \\nnumber of cells is Md and this grows exponentially with the dimensionality of \\nthe input space. Since each cell must contain at least one data point, this implies \\nthat the quantity of (raining data needed to specify the mapping also grows \\nexponentially. This phenomenon lias been termed the curse of dimensionalUy 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nFigure 1.5. One way to specify a mapping from a d-dimensional space x\\\\,..., x£ \\nto an output variable y is to divide the input space into a number of cells, as \\nindicated here for the case of d = 3, and to specify the value of y for each of \\nthe cells. The major problem with this approach is that the number of cells, \\nand hence the number of example data points required, grows exponentially \\nwith d, a phenomenon known as the 'curse of dimensionality'. \\n(Bellman, 1961). If we are forced to work with a limited quantity of data, as we\", 'are in practice, then increasing the dimensionality of the space rapidly leads to \\nthe point where the data is very sparse, in which case it provides a very poor \\nrepresentation of the mapping. \\nOf course, the technique of dividing up the input space into cells is a par\\xad\\nticularly inefficient way to represent a multivariate non-linear function. In sub\\xad\\nsequent chapters we shall consider other approaches to this problem, based on \\nfeed-forward neural networks, which are much less susceptible to the curse of \\ndimensionality. These techniques are able to exploit two important properties of \\nreal data. First, the input variables are generally correlated in some way, so that \\nthe data points do not fill out the entire input space but tend to be restricted to \\na sub-space of lower dimensionality. This leads to the concept of intrinsic dimen\\xad\\nsionality which is discussed further in Section 8.6.1. Second, for most mappings', 'of practical interest, the value of the output variables will not change arbitrarily \\nfrom one region of input space to another, but will typically vary smoothly as \\na function of the input variables. Thus, it is possible to infer the values of the \\noutput variables at intermediate points, where no data is available, by a process \\nsimilar to interpolation. \\nAlthough the effects of dimensionality are generally not as severe as the exam\\xad\\nple of Figure 1.5 might suggest, it remains true that, in many problems, reducing \\nthe number of input variables can sometimes lead to improved performance for \\na given data set, even though information is being discarded. The fixed quantity \\nof data is better able to specify the mapping in the lower-dimensional space, and \\nthis more than compensates for the loss of information. In our simple character \\nrecognition problem we could have considered all 65 536 pixel values as inputs', \"to our non-linear model. Such an approach, however, would be expected to give \\nextremely poor results as a consequence of the effects of dimensionality coupled \\nwith a limited size of data set. As we shall discuss in Chapter 8, one of the impor\\xad\\ntant roles of pre-processing in many applications is to reduce the dimensionality 1.5: Polynomial curve fitting 9 \\nof the data before using it to train a neural network or other pattern recognition \\nsystem. \\n1.5 Polynomial curve fitting \\nMany of the important issues concerning the application of neural networks \\ncan be introduced in the simpler context of polynomial curve fitting. Here the \\nproblem is to fit a polynomial to a set of N data points by the technique of \\nminimizing an error function. Consider the Mth-order polynomial given by \\nM \\ny(x) = WQ+ wix H \\\\- WMXM = 2^ WjX*'. (1.2) \\nj=o \\nThis can be regarded as a non-linear mapping which takes x as input and pro\\xad\\nduces y as output. The precise form of the function y(x) is determined by the\", 'values of the parameters woi • • •%, which are analogous to the weights in a \\nneural network. It is convenient to denote the set of parameters (WQ, ..., WM) by \\nthe vector w. The polynomial can then be written as a functional mapping in \\nthe form y = y(x; w) as was done for more general non-linear mapping^^i (1.1). \\nWe shall label the data with the index n = 1,..., N, so that each dAte point \\nconsists of a value of a;, denoted by a;\", and a corresponding desired*<|$ilue for \\nthe output y, which we shall denote by tn. These desired outputs ajce called \\ntarget values in the neural network context. In order to find suitable .yalues for \\nthe coefficients in the polynomial, it is convenient to consider the error between \\nthe desired output tn, for a particular input xn, and the corresponding value \\npredicted by the polynomial function given by y(xn;w). Standard curj^e-fitting \\nprocedures involve minimizing the square of this error, summed over all data \\npoints, given by \\n1 N', \"E = -Y,{y(xn;v)-n2- .(i.3) 71=1 \\nWe can regard E as being a function of w, and so the polynomial can be fitted \\nto the data by choosing a value for w, which we denote by w*, which minimizes \\nE. Note that the polynomial (1.2) is a linear function of the parameters w \\nand so (1.3) is a quadratic function of w. This means that the minimum of \\nE can be found in terms of the solution of a set of linear algebraic equations \\n(Exercise 1.5). Functions which depend linearly on the adaptive parameters are \\ncalled linear models, even though they may be non-linear functions of the original \\ninput variables. Many concepts which arise in the study of such models are also \\nof direct relevance to the more complex non-linear neural networks considered in \\nChapters 4 and 5. We therefore present an extended discussion of linear models \\n(in the guise of 'single-layer networks') in Chapter 3. 10 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition\", \"The minimization of an error function such a,s (1.3), which involves target \\nvalues for the network outputs, is called supervised learning since for each input \\npatter.i the value of the desired ouiput is specified.

Error functions play an important role in the use of neural networks, and \\nthe whole of Chapter G is devoted to a detailed discussion of their properties. \\nThere we snail see how the sum-of-squares error function can be derived from \\nsome general statistical principles, provided we make certain assumptions about \\n1,1.e j/roper.iles of the data.

Specifically, we generate \\ntraining data from the function \\nh{x) = 0.5 -1-0.4m.(2i\\\\-x) (1.4) \\nby sampling the function /i.(x) at equal intervals of x and then adding random \\nnoise with a, Gaussian distribution (Section 2.1.1) having standard deviation\", 'a = 0.05. Thus Tor each data point a new value for the noise contribution is \\nchosen. A basic property of most data sets of interest, in pattern recognition is \\nthat the data exhibits an underlying systematic aspect, represented in this case \\nby the function h(x), but is corrupted with random noise. The central goal in \\npattern recognition is to produce a system which makes good predictions for \\nnew data, in other words one which exhibits good generalization. In order to \\nmeasure the generalization capabilities of the polynomial, we have generated a \\nsecond data set called a test set, wliich is produced in the same way as the \\ntraining set, but with new values for the noise component. This reflects the basic \\nassumption that the data on which we wish to use the pattern recognition system \\nis produced by the same underlying mechanism as the training data. As we shall \\ndiscuss at length in Chapter 9, the best generalization to new data is obtained', 'when the mapping represents the underlying systematic aspects of the data, \\nrather capturing the specific details (i.e. the noise contribution) of the particular \\ntraining set. We will therefore be interested in seeing how close the polynomial \\ny(x) is to the function h(x). \\nFigure 1.6 shows the 11 points from the training set, as well as the function 1.5: Polynomial curve fitting 11 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 0.5 x 1.0 \\nFigure l.C.

We can obtain a better fit by', 'increasing the order of the polynomial, since this increases the number of degrees \\nof freedom (i.e. the number of free parameters) in the function, which gives \\nit greater flexibility. Figure 1.7 shows the result of fitting a cubic polynomial \\n(M = 3) which gives a much better approximation to h(x). If, however, we \\nincrease the order of the polynomial too far, then the approximation to the \\nunderlying function actually gets worse. Figure 1.8 shows the result of fitting a \\nlOth-order polynomial (M = 10). This is now able to achieve a perfect fit to the \\ntraining data, since a 10th- order polynomial has 11 free parameters, and there \\nare 11 data points. However, the polynomial has fitted the data by developing \\nsome dramatic oscillations. Such functions are said to be over-fitted to the data. \\nAs a consequence, this function gives a poor representation of h(x). \\n1.5.1 Generalization \\nIn order to assess the capability of the polynomial to generalize to new data, it', 'is convenient to consider the root-mean-square (RMS) error given by \\nA^>(x\";w*)-r.»}2 (L5) \\nwhere w* represents the vector of coefficients corresponding to the minimum \\nof the error function, so that y(x;\\\\v*) represents the fitted polynomial.

Figure 1.9 shows a plot of £RMS for both the training data set and the \\ntest data set, as a function of the order M of the polynomial.

Generalization is treated at greater length in Chapter 9, where we \\ndiscuss the trade-off between the bias and the variance of a model. A model \\nwhich has too little flexibility, such as the linear polynomial of Figure 1.6, has a', 'high bias, while a model which has too much flexibility, such as the lOth-order \\npolynomial of Figure 1.8, has a high variance.

Fig\\xad\\nures 1.10-1.12 show a succession of decision boundaries for a schematic example \\nof a classification problem involving two classes, and two input variables. As the \\ncomplexity of the model is increased, so the decision boundary can become more \\ncomplex and hence give a better fit to the training data. For many applications, \\nhowever, the best generalization performance is again obtained from a model \\nwith an intermediate level of flexibility. 14 I: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\n\"igiiie 1.1 1.

In many applications the distributions of data from different \\nclasses overlap, and the best generalization perfor.i.a.icc is then achieved by a \\nmodel with intermediate complexity, corresponding to the decision boundary \\nin Figure i.ll. \\n1.6 Model courplexity \\nUsing an example of polynomial curve fitting, wc have seen that the best gener\\xad\\nalization performance is achieved by a model whose complexity (measured here \\nby the order of the polynomial) is neither too small nor too large. The problem \\nof finding the optimal complexity for a model provides an example of Occam's \\nrazor, named, after William of Occam (1285-1319). This is the principle tlr.it. wo \\nshould prefer simpler models to more complex models, and that this preference \\nshould be traded off against the extent to which the models fit the data. Thus a\", \"highly complex model wdiich fits the data extremely well (such as the lOfh-order 1.7: Multivariate non-linear functions 15 \\npolynomial above) actually gives a poorer representation of the systematic as\\xad\\npects of the data than would a simpler mode) (such as the .jr.l-order polynomial). \\nA model whioi is too simple, however, as in the Ist-crdcr polynomial, is also not \\nprefered as 1!; gives too poor a fit to the data. 'Die same considerations apply to \\nneural network models, whore again we can control the complexify of the model \\noy coni.ro.ilng t..o number of free parameters which it possesses. \\nAn alterative approach to optimizing the generalization performance of a \\nmodel is to control lis effective complexity.

The total error then \\nLc-eomes \\nE^E + vil (l.C)\", \"where O is called a regulariza'ion. term. The value of £?. depends on the mapping \\nfunction l(x). and if the functional form of fi is chosen appropriately, it can be \\nused to control over-fitting. For example, if we examine the function represented \\nby the lOth-order polynomial in Figure 1.8, we sec that it has large oscillations, \\nand hence the function ;,(:?;) has regions of large curvature. We might therefore \\nchoose a regularization function which is large for functions with large values of \\nthe second derivative, such, as \\nThe parameter v in (l.C) controls the extent to which the regularization term \\ninlluences the form of the solution, and hence controls the effective complexity \\nof the moc'ei. Rogi.larizafio.i is discussed in greater detail in Sections 5.4, 9.2 \\nand 10.1.5. \\nWe have seen that, for a fixed size of data, set, it is important to achieve the \\noptimum level of complexity for the model in order to minimize the combina\\xad\", 'tion of bias and variance. By using a sequence of successively larger data sets, \\nhowever, and a corresponding set of models with successively greater complexity, \\nit is possible in principle to reduce both bias and variance simultaneously and \\nhence to improve the generalization performance of the network. The ultimate \\ngeneralization achievable will be limited by the intrinsic noise on the data. \\n1.7 Multivariate nou-!h,enr t:nof;,ons \\nThe role of neural nefwoiks, as \\'.v.- have already indicated, is to provide general \\nparametrized non-linear mapping\" between n. set of input variables and a set of \\noutput variables. Polynomials piovide such mappings for the case of one input \\nvariable arid one output variable. Provided we have a sufficiently large num\\xad\\nber of terms in the poiy.iomial, we can approximate any reasonable function to \\narbitrary accuracy. \\'J his suggests that we could simply extend the concept ol 16 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition', \"a polynomial to higher dimensions.

While this now has a power \\nlaw dependence on d, rather than the exponential dependence of the model \\nrepresented in Figure 1:$, it still represents a dramatic growth in the number of \\ndegrees of freedom of themodel as the dimensionality of the input space increases. \\nFor medium to large applications, such a model!would need huge quantities of \\ntraining data in order tb ensure that the adaptive parameters (the coefficients \\nin the polynomial) were well determined. •: '. \\nThere are in fact many different ways in which to represent general non-linear\", \"mappings between multidimensional spaces. The importance of neural networks, \\nand similar techniques, lies in the way in which they deal with the problem of \\nscaling with dimensionality. Generally, these models represent non-linear func\\xad\\ntions of many variables; in terms of superpositions of non-linear functions of a \\nsingle variable, which we; might call 'hidden functions' (also called hidden units). \\nThe key point is that the hidden functions are themselves adapted to the data \\nas part of the training process, and so the number of such functions only needs \\nto grow as the complexity of the problem itself grows, and not simply as the \\ndimensionality grows. The number of free parameters in such models, for a given \\nnumber of hidden functions, typically only growsilinearly, of quadratically, with \\nthe dimensionality of the input space, as compared with, the dM growth for a \\ngeneral Mth-order polynomial. We devote Chapters 4 and 5 to a study of two off\", \"the most popular such models, known respectively as the multi-layer perceptrpn \\nand the radial basis function network. . \\nBarron (1993) has studied the way in which the residual sum-of-squares er\\xad\\nror decreases as the number of parameters in a model is increased. For neural \\nnetworks he showed that this error falls as 0(1 jM) where M is the number Of \\nhidden units in the network,1 irrespective of the number of input variables. By \\ncontrast, the error only decreases as 0{1/M2^d)y where d is the dimensionality \\nof input space, for polynomials or indeed any other series expansion in which it \\nis the coefficients of linear combinations of fixed functions which are adapted. \\nWe see that neural networks therefore offer a dramatic advantage for function \\napproximation in spaces,of many dimensions. ' \\nThe price which we pay for this efficient scaling with dimensionality is that \\nthe network functions are now necessarily non-linear functions of the adaptive\", \"parameters. Unlike polynomial curve fitting, the procedure for determining the \\nvalues of the parameters is now a problem in non-linear optimization, which is \\ncomputationally intensive and which presents a number of additional complica- 1.8: Bayea' theorem 17 \\ntions, such as the presence of multiple minima in the error function. Chapter 7 is \\ntherefore concerned with the important topic of finding efficient algorithms for \\nperforming this optimization. \\n1.8 Bayes' theorem \\nIn the remainder of this chapter we introduce some of the basic concepts of the \\nstatistical approach to pattern recognition, in preparation for later chapters. For \\nreaders interested in a more detailed account of these topics there are many stan\\xad\\ndard textbooks which specialize in this area, including Duda and Hart (1973), \\nHand (1981), Devijver and Kittler (1982), and Fukunaga (1990). Rather than \\npresent these concepts in an abstract fashion, we let them unfold naturally in\", \"the context of the character recognition problem introduced at the start of this \\nchapter. \\nWe begin by supposing that we wish to classify a new character but as yet we \\nhave made no measurements on the image of that character. The goal is to classify \\nthe character in such a way as to minimize the probability of misclassification. If \\nwe had collected a large number of examples of the characters, we could find the \\nfractions which belong in each of the two classes. We formalize this by introducing \\nthe prior probabilities P(Ck) of an image belonging to each of the classes Cj.. \\nThese correspond to the fractions of characters in each class, in the limit of an \\ninfinite number of observations. Thus, if the letter 'a' occurs three times as often \\nas the letter 'b\\\\ we have P(Ci) = 0.75 and P{C2) = 0.25. \\nIf we were forced to classify a new character without being allowed to see \\nthe corresponding image, then the best we can do is to assign it to the class\", \"having the higher prior probability. That is, we assign the image to class C\\\\ if \\nP{Ci) > P(C2), and to class C% otherwise. In the character recognition example, \\nthis means we would always classify a new character as 'a'. This procedure \\nminimizes the probability of misclassification, even though we know that some \\nof the images will correspond to the character 'b'. \\nNow suppose that we have measured the value of the feature variable x\\\\ for \\nthe image. It is clear from Figure 1.2 that this gives us further information on \\nwhich to base our classification decision, and We seek a formalism which allows \\nthis information to be combined with the prior probabilities which we already \\npossess. To begin with, we shall suppose that X\\\\ is assigned to one of a discrete \\nset of values {X1}, as was done for the histogram plot of Figure 1.2. We can \\nrepresent this information in a slightly different way, as an array of cells, as in\", \"Figure 1.13. The joint probability P{Ck, X1) is defined to be the probability that \\nthe image has the feature value X1 and belongs to class Ck- This corresponds to \\nthe fraction of the images which Ifall into'a particular cell (in row Ck and column \\nX1) in the limit of an infinite number of images. The prior probabilities P(Ck) \\nintroduced earlier correspond to the total fraction of images in the corresponding \\nrow of the array. \\nNext we introduce the conditional probability P(Xl\\\\Ck) which specifies the \\nprobability that the observation falls in column X' of the array given that it 18 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\n\\\\x'. \\nFigure 1.13. Data from the histogram of Figure 1.2 represented as an array. \\nThe feature variable £i can take one of! the discrete values X1 and each image \\nis assigned to one of the two classes Ci'or G2. The number of dots in each cell \\nrepresents the number of images having the corresponding value of X1 and the\", \"corresponding class label. Various probabilities are defined in the text in terms \\nof the fraction of points faffing in different regions of the array. \\nbelongs to class Ck- It is given by the fraction of :the ijmages in row Ck which fall \\nin cell X1 (in the limit of an infinite number of images). \\nWe now note that the fraction of the total number of images which fall into \\ncell (Ck,Xl) is given by the fraction of ;the number of images in row Ck which \\nfall in cell {Ck, X1) times the fraction of the total nuinber of images which fall in \\nrow Ck- This is equivalent 'to writing the joint probability inthe form \\nP{Ck,X}) ^ PiXl\\\\Ck)HCk)A (1-9) \\nBy a similar argument, we can see that the joint probability can also be written \\nin the form \\nPick,xl) = F%Ck\\\\xl)p{xly (1.10) \\nwhere P(Ck\\\\Xl) is the probability that the class; is Ck given that the measured \\nvalue of x\\\\ falls in the celi X1. The quantity ff(X')'is the probability of ob\\xad\", \"serving a value X1 with respect to the •fvhole data set, irrespective of the class \\nmembership, and is therefore given by the fraction of the total number of images \\nwhich fall into column Xh The two expressions for the joint probabilities in (1.9) \\nand (110) must, however, be equal. Thus, we cah write \\nP(Ck\\\\Xl) P(Xl\\\\Ck)P(Ck) \\ni P(xl). • (1-11) \\nThis expression is referred to as Bayes' theorem (after the Revd. Thomas Bayes, \\n1702-1761). The quantity on the left-hand side of (l.ll) is called the posterior \\nprobability, since it gives the probability that the class is Ck after we have made \\na measurement of xi- Bayes' theorem allows the posterior probability to be \\nexpressed in terms of the prior probability P(Cjt), together with the quantity \\nP{Xl\\\\Ck) which is called the class-conditional probability of X1 for class Ck- 1.8: Bayes' theorem 19 \\n1.0 \\n0.0 \\nA 3c, \\nFigure 1.14. Histogram plot of posterior probabilities, corresponding to the\", \"histogram of observations in Figure 1:2, for prior probabilities P(Ci) = 0.6 \\nand P(C2) = 0.4. \\nThe denominator in Bayes' theorem, P(Xl), plays the role of a normalization \\nfactor, and ensures that the posterior probabilities sum to unity. As we shall \\nsee shortly, the posterior probability is a quantity of central interest since it \\nallows us to make optimal decisions regarding the class membership of new data. \\nIn particular, assigning a new image to the class having the largest posterior \\nprobability minimizes the probability of misclassification of that image. \\nThe denominator in Bayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of the prior \\nprobabilities and the class-conditional probabilities. To do this we note that any \\nnew measurement must be assigned to one of the two classes C\\\\ or C2. Thus \\nP(Cl\\\\Xl) + P(C2\\\\Xl) = l. (1.12) \\nSubstituting (1.11) into (1.12) we obtain \\n, P(X') = P(X'|Ci)P(C1) + P(Xi|C2)P(C2). (1.13) \\n1.8.1 Inference and decision\", \"The importance of Bayes' theorem lies in the fact that it re-expresses the poste\\xad\\nrior probabilities in terms of quantities which are often much easier to calculate. \\nWe have seen in our character recognition example that the prior probabilities \\ncan be estimated from the proportions of the training data which fall into each \\nof the classes. Similarly, the class-conditional probabilities P(Xl\\\\Ck) could be \\nestimated from the histograms of Figure 1.2. From these quantities we can also \\nfind the normalization factor in Bayes' theorem, by use of (1.13), and hence eval\\xad\\nuate the posterior probabilities. Figure 1.14 shows the histograms of posterior \\nprobability, corresponding to the class^conditional probabilities in Figure 1.2, for \\nprior probabilities P(Ci) = 0.6 and P(C2) = 0.4. \\nFor a new image, having feature value X1, the probability of misclassificatton \\nis minimized if we assign the image to the class Ck for which the posterior prob\\xad\", 'ability P(Ck\\\\Xl) is largest, as we shall demonstrate in Section 1.9. Thus, if we kP(C,l3c,) \\n• r-\\n_-_* P(C2I*,) \\nI I 20 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nobserve a new image with feature value A, as shown in Figure 1.14, it should be \\nassigned to class C\\\\. \\nIn some cases the prior probabilities can be estimated directly from the train\\xad\\ning data itself. However, it sometimes happens (often by design) that the frac\\xad\\ntions of examples from different classes in the training data set differ from the \\nprobabilities expected when our trained pattern recognition system is applied to \\nnew data. As an example, consider the problem of designing a system to distin\\xad\\nguish between normal tissue (class C\\\\) and tumours (class C%) on medical X-ray \\nimages, for use in mass screening. From medical statistics we may know that, \\nin the general population, the probability of observing a tumour is 1% and so \\nwe should use prior probabilities of P{C\\\\) = 0.99 and P(C2) = 0.01. In collect\\xad', \"ing a training data set, however, we might choose to include equal numbers of \\nexamples from both classes to ensure that we get a reasonable number of repre\\xad\\nsentatives of tumours, without having to use a huge number of images in total. \\nWe can still use the images in our data set to estimate the class-conditional \\nprobabilities P(Xl\\\\Ck) and then use Bayes' theorem to Calculate the correct pos\\xad\\nterior probabilities using the known prior probabilities. Note that in practice \\nthese prior probabilities could be obtained from medical statistics without the \\nneed to collect images or determine their class. In this example, failure to take \\ncorrect account of the prior probabilities would lead to significantly sub-optimal \\nresults. \\nOne approach to statistical pattern recognition is therefore to evaluate the \\nclass-conditional probabilities and the prior probabilities separately and then \\ncombine them using Bayes' theorem to give posterior probabilities, which can\", 'then be used to classify new examples. An alternative approach is to estimate \\nthe posterior probability functions directly. As we shall see in Chapter 6, the \\noutputs of a neural network can be interpreted as (approximations to) posterior \\nprobabilities, provided the error function used to train the network is chosen \\nappropriately. \\nIt is important to distinguish between two separate stages in the classification \\nprocess. The first is inference whereby data is used to determine values for the \\nposterior probabilities. These are then used in the second stage which is decision \\nmaking in which those probabilities are used to make decisions such as assigning \\na new data point to one of the possible classes. So far we have based classifica\\xad\\ntion decisions on the goal of minimizing the probability of misclassification. In \\nSection 1.10 we shall discuss more general decision criteria, and introduce the \\nconcept of a loss matrix.', 'As we have indicated, the minimum probability of misclassification is ob\\xad\\ntained by assigning each new observation to the class for which the posterior \\nprobability is largest. In the literature this is sometimes referred to as the \"Bayes\\' \\nrule\". We avoid this terminology, however, since the role of Bayes\\' theorem is \\nin the evaluation of posterior probabilities, and this is quite distinct from any \\nsubsequent decision procedure. 1.8: Bayes\\' theorem 21 \\n1.8.2 Bayesian versus frequentist statistics \\nUntil now we have defined probabilities in terms of fractions of a set of obser\\xad\\nvations in the limit where the number of observations tends to infinity. Such a \\nview of probabilities is known as frequentist. There is, however, a totally differ\\xad\\nent way of viewing the same formalism. Consider, for example, the problem of \\npredicting the winner of a bicycle race. The \\'probability\\' of a particular cyclist \\nwinning does not sit naturally within the frequentist framework since the race', \"will take place only once, and so it will not be possible to perform a large number \\nof trials. Nevertheless, it would not seem unusual to hear someone say that a \\nparticular cyclist has a 30% probability of winning. In this! case we are using \\nthe term 'probability' to express a subjective 'degree of belief in a particular \\noutcome. \\nSuppose we try to encode these subjective beliefs as real numbers. In a key \\npaper, Cox (1946) showed that, provided we impose soma simple, and very nat\\xad\\nural, consistency requirements, we are led uniquely to the Bayesian formalism. \\nIf we use a value of 1 to dendtb complete certainty that an event will occur, and \\n0 to denote complete certainty that the event will not occu^r (with intermedi\\xad\\nate values representing corresponding degrees of belief), then these real values \\nbehave exactly like conventional probabilities. Bayes' theorem then provides us \\nwith a precise quantitative prescription for updating these probabilities when we\", \"are presented with new data. The prior probability represents our degree of belief \\nbefore the data arrives. After we observe the data, we can use Bayes' theorem \\nto convert this prior probability into a posterior probability. Jaynes (1986) gives \\nan enlightening review of the fascinating, and sometimes: controversial, history \\nof Bayesian statistics. \\n1.8.3 Probability densities .;., \\nSo far we have treated the feature variable x\\\\ by discretizing it into a finite set \\nof values. In many applications it will be more appropriate to! regard the feature \\nvariables as continuous. Probabilities for discrete variables arte then replaced by \\nprobability densities^ From now on we shall omit the ~ symbol and suppose that \\nthe variables Xj now refer to input quantities after any pre-protessing and feature \\nextraction have been, performed. \\nA probability density function p(x) specifies that the probability of the vari\\xad\\nable x lying in the interval between any two points x = a and x = b is given\", 'by \\nP(xe[a,b})= f p(x)dx.

For continuous variables, the \\nclass-conditional probabilities introduced above become class-conditional prob- 22 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nability density functions, which we write in the form p(x|Cjt).

One application for \\nsuch techniques is for estimating class-conditional densities for subsequent use \\nin Bayes' theorem to find posterior probabilities. \\nIn most practical pattern classification problems it is necessary to use more \\nthan one feature variable. We may also wish to consider more than two possible \\nclasses, so that in our character recognition problem we might consider more than \\ntwo characters. For c different classes Ci,...,Cc, and for a continuous feature \\nvector x, we can write Bayes' theorem in the form \\n»l=*f« 0.2!) \\nwhere the unconditional density p(x) is given by \\nc \\np(x) = ]Tp(x|Cfc)P(Cfc) (1-22) \\nwhich ensures that the posterior probabilities sum to unity \\nv c \\n. £)P(Cfc|x) = l.

Since the unconditional \\ndensity p(x) is independent of the class, it may be dropped from the Bayes' 24 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition\", 'formula for the purposes of comparing posterior probabilities. Thus, we can use \\n(1.21) to write the criterion (1.25) in the form \\np(x\\\\Ck)P(Ck) > pMCJPiCj) for all j ? k. (1.26) \\nA pattern classifier provides a rule for assigning each point of feature space \\nto one of c classes. We can therefore regard the feature space as being divided \\nup into c decision regions 7£i,... ,7JC such that a point falling in region 1Zk is \\nassigned to class Ck. Note that each of these regions need not be contiguous, \\nbut may itself be divided into several disjoint regions all of which are associated \\nwith the same class. The boundaries between these regions are known as decision \\nsurfaces or decision boundaries. \\nIn order to find the optimal criterion for placement of decision boundaries, \\nconsider again the case of a one-dimensional feature space x and two classes \\nC\\\\ and C2. We seek a decision boundary which minimizes the probability of', 'misclassification, as illustrated in Figure 1.15. A misclassification error will occur \\nif we assign a new pattern to class C\\\\ when in fact it belongs to class C2, or vice \\nversa. We can calculate the total probability of an error of either kind by writing \\n(Duda and Hart, 1973) \\nP(error) = P(x € K2,Ci) + P(x 6 fti,C2) \\n= P{x e ft2|Ci)P(Ci) + P(x e fti|C2)P(Ca) \\n= / p(x\\\\Ci)P(Ci)dx+ f p(x\\\\C2)P(C2)dx (1.27) \\nwhere P(x 6 7^i,C2) is the joint probability of x being assigned to class C\\\\ and \\nthe true class being C2.

The same result can be \\nseen graphically in Figure 1.15, in which misclassification errors arise from the \\nshaded region. By choosing the decision boundary to coincide with the value of x', 'at which the two distributions cross (shown by the arrow) we minimize the area \\nof the shaded region and hence minimize the probability of misclassification.

This observation allows us to reformulate the classification \\nprocess in terms of a set of discriminant functions yi(x),...., yc(x) such that an \\ninput vector x is assigned to class Ck if \\nyfc(x) > yj(x) forallj^fc. (1.29) \\nThe decision rule for minimizing the probability of misclassification may easily \\nbe cast in terms of discriminant functions, simply by choosing \\nyfc(x) = P(Cfc|x). (1.30)', \"If we use Bayes' theorem, and note that the unconditional density p(x) in the \\ndenominator does not depend on the class label Ck, and therefore does not affect \\nthe classification decision, we can write an equivalent discriminant function in 26 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\nthe form \\nifr(x) = p(x\\\\Ck)P(Ck). (1.31) \\nSince it is only the relative magnitudes of the discriminant functions which are \\nimportant in determining the class, we can replace j/it(x) by g(yk(x)), where g() \\nis any monotonic function, and the decisions of the classifier will not be affected. \\nBy taking logarithms for example, we could write our discriminant functions in \\nthe form \\nyk (x) = In p(x|Cfc) + In P(Ck). (1.32) \\nIn general the decision boundaries are given by the regions where the discrimi\\xad\\nnant functions are equal, so that if Tlk and TZj are contiguous then the decision \\nboundary separating them is given by \\nj/fc(x) = Vj(x). •; : (1.33)\", 'The locations of the decision boundaries are therefore unaffected by monotonic \\ntransformations of the discriminant functions. \\nDiscriminant functions for two-class decision problems are traditionally writ\\xad\\nten in a slightly different form. Instead of using two discriminant functions j/i (x) \\nand J/2 (x), we introduce a single discriminant function \\n0(x) = yi(x)-ifc(x) (1.34) \\nand we now use the rule that x is assigned to class C\\\\ if j/(x) > 0 and to class \\nCi if j/(x) < 0.

However, by relating the', 'discriminant functions to the probabilities, we retain the link to the optimal \\ncriteria of decision theory introduced above. There are also important links be\\xad\\ntween discriminant functions and neural networks, and these will be explored in 1.10: Minimizing risk 27 \\nsubsequent chapters. \\n1.10 Minimizing risk \\nSo far we have based our classification decisions on the desire to minimize the \\nprobability of misclassifying a new pattern. In many applications this may not \\nbe the most appropriate criterion. Consider for instance the medical screening \\nproblem discussed on page 20. There may be much more serious consequences if \\nwe classify an image of a tumour as normal than if we classify a normal image \\nas that of a tumour. Such effects may easily be taken into account as follows. \\nWe define a loss matrix with elements Lkj specifying the penalty associated \\nwith assigning a pattern to class Cj when in fact it belongs to class Ck. Consider', 'all the patterns x which belong to class Ck. Then the expected (i.e. average) loss \\nfor those patterns is given by \\nRk = YJLki ( p(x\\\\Ck)dx. (1.37) \\nThus, the overall expected loss, or risk, for patterns from all classes is \\nc \\n/l=^J?fcP(Cfc) (1.38) \\n= E/ \\\\i^Lkip{x\\\\Ck)P(Ck)\\\\ dx. \\nJ=IJKI U=I J \\nThis risk is minimized if the integrand is minimized at each point x, that is if \\nthe regions TZj are chosen such that x e Tlj when \\nc c \\nY, LkjP(x\\\\Ck)P(Ck) < Y, LkiP(x\\\\Ck)P(Ck) for all i ? j (1.39) \\nfc=i fc=i \\nwhich represents a generalization of the usual decision rule for minimizing the \\nprobability of misclassification. Note that, if we assign a loss of 1 if the pattern \\nis placed in the wrong class, and a loss of 0 if it is placed in the correct class, \\nso that Lkj = 1 — 6kj (where <5/y is the Kronecker delta symbol defined on \\npage xiii), then (1.39) reduces to the decision rule for minimizing the probability', 'of misclassification, given by (1.26). In an application such as the medical image \\nclassification problem, the values of the coefficients Lkj would probably be chosen \\nby hand, based on the views of experienced medical staff. For other applications, \\nin finance for example, it may be possible to choose values for the L/y in a more \\nsystematic fashion since the risks can be more easily quantified. 28 1: Statistical Pattern Recognition \\n1.10.1 Rejection thresholds \\nIn general we expect most of the misclassification errors to occur in those regions \\nof x-space where the largest of the posterior probabilities is relatively low, since \\nthere is then a strong overlap between different classes. In some applications \\nit may be better not to make a classification decision in such cases. This is \\nsometimes called the reject option. For the medical classification problem for \\nexample, it may be better not to rely on an automatic classification system in', 'doubtful cases, but to have these classified instead by a human expert. We then \\narrive at the following procedure \\n• r nir, i \\\\ f > #. then classify x ,n ... \\nif maxP(C,|x) |— ^ te.ec^ (1.40) \\nwhere 9 is a threshold in the range (0,1). The larger the value of 9, the fewer \\npoints will be classified. One way in which the reject option can be used is to \\nto design a relatively simple but fast classifier system to cover the bulk of the \\nfeature space, while leaving the remaining regions to a more sophisticated system \\nwhich might be relatively slow. \\nThe reject option can be applied to neural networks by making use of the \\nresult, to be discussed in Chapter 6, that the outputs of a correctly trained \\nnetwork approximate Bayesian posterior probabilities. \\nExercises \\n1.1 (*) The first four exercises explore the failure of common intuition when \\ndealing with spaces of many dimensions.

The methods we describe can be used to build classifier \\nsystems by considering each of the classes C^ in turn, and estimating the corre\\xad\", \"sponding class-conditional densities p(x\\\\Ck) by making use of the fact that each \\ndata point is labelled according to its class. These densities can then be used in \\nBayes' theorem (Section 1.8) to find the posterior probabilities corresponding to \\na new measurement of x, which can in turn be used to make a classification of \\nx. \\nDensity estimation can also be applied to unlabelled data (that is data with\\xad\\nout any class labels) where it has a number of applications. In the context of \\nneural networks it can be applied to the distribution of data in the input space \\nas part of the training process for radial basis function networks (Section 5.9), \\nand to provide a method for validating the outputs of a trained neural network \\n(Bishop, 1994b). \\nIn Chapter 6, techniques for density estimation are combined with neural \\nnetwork models to provide a general framework for modelling conditional density \\nfunctions. \\nHere we consider three alternative approaches to density estimation. The\", 'first of these involves parametric methods in which a specific functional form \\nfor the density model is assumed. This contains a number of parameters which \\nare then optimized by fitting the model to the data set. The drawback of such \\nan approach is that the particular form of parametric function chosen might be \\nincapable of providing a good representation of the true density. By contrast, \\nthe second technique of non-parametric estimation does not assume a particular \\nfunctional form, but allows the form of the density to be determined entirely \\nby the data. Such methods typically suffer from the problem that the number \\nof parameters in the model grows with the size of the data set, so that the \\nmodels can quickly become unwieldy. The third approach, sometimes called semi-\\nparametric estimation, tries to achieve the best of both worlds by allowing a very \\ngeneral class of functional forms in which the number of adaptive parameters can', 'be increased in a systematic way to build ever more flexible models, but where the \\ntotal number of parameters in the model can be varied independently from the \\nsize of the data set. We shall focus on semi-parametric models based on mixture \\ndistributions. Feed-forward neural networks can be regarded as semi-parametric 34 S: Probability Density Estimation \\nmodels for conditional density estimation, as discussed further in Chapter 6. \\nIt should be emphasized that accurate modelling of probability densities from \\nfinite data sets in spaces of high dimensionality (where high could be as low as \\nd = 10) is, in general, extremely difficult. In Exercise 1.4 it was shown that most \\nof the probability mass associated with a Gaussian distribution in a space of high \\ndimensionality occurs in a thin shell at large radius. With a finite data set, there \\nmay be few, if any, data points associated with the region of high probability', \"density near the origin. This is another example of the 'curse of dimensionality' \\ndiscussed in Section 1.4. \\nThe techniques described in this chapter are not only of great interest in \\ntheir own right, but they also provide an excellent introduction to many of the \\ncentral issues which must be addressed when using neural networks in practical \\napplications. More extensive discussions of density estimation can be found in \\nDuda and Hart (1973), Titterington et al. (1985), Silverman (1986), McLachlan \\nand Basford (1988), Pukunaga (1990) and Scott (1992). \\n2.1 Parametric methods \\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to density estimation is to represent \\nthe probability density p(x) in terms of a specific functional form which contains \\na number of adjustable parameters. The values of the parameters can then be \\noptimized to give the best fit to the data. The simplest, and most widely used, \\nparametric model is the normal or Gaussian distribution, which has a number\", 'of convenient analytical and statistical properties. Since our aim is to explain the \\nbasic principles of parametric density estimation, we shall limit our discussion \\nto normal distributions. \\nWe shall also describe the two principal techniques for determining the pa\\xad\\nrameters of the model distribution, known respectively as maximum likelihood \\nand Bayesian inference. As an illustration of the Bayesian approach, we consider \\nthe problem of finding the mean of a normal distribution. Bayesian methods are \\nalso considered in Chapter 10 where they are applied to the more complex prob\\xad\\nlem of learning in neural networks. We shall also consider stochastic techniques \\nfor on-line learning in which the data values arrive sequentially and must be \\ndiscarded as soon as they are used. \\n2.1.1 The normal distribution \\nThe normal density function, for the case of a single variable, can be written in \\nthe form \\nK*)=(^-p{-^} (2.D', 'where \\\\i and a2 are called the mean and variance respectively, and the parameter \\no (which is the square root of the variance) is called the standard deviation.

The contours of constant den\\xad\\nsity are then hyperspheres. A surface plot of the normal distribution for this \\ncase is shown in Figure 2.2. Although these simplified distributions have fewer \\nparameters, they also clearly have less generality. \\n2.1.2 Properties of the normal distribution \\nThe normal distribution has a number of important properties which make it a \\ncommon choice for use in parametric density estimation: 2.1: Parametric methods 37 \\nFigure 2.2. Surface plot of a normal distribution in two dimensions for a diag\\xad\\nonal covariance matrix governed by a single variance parameter a2. \\n1. It has relatively simple analytical properties allowing many useful results \\nto be obtained explicitly. For instance, any moment of the distribution can \\nbe expressed as a function of fx and S. \\n2. The central limit theorem states that, under rather general circumstances, \\nthe mean of M random variables tends to be distributed normally, in the', 'limit as M tends to infinity. The main condition is that the variance of any \\none variable should not dominate. A common application is to the sum \\nof a set of variables drawn independently from the same distribution. In \\npractice, convergence tends to be very rapid, so that for values of M as \\nsmall as 10 the approximation to a normal distribution can be very good. \\nWe might hope that measurements of naturally occurring phenomena have \\nseveral constituent components, leading to a distribution which is close to \\nnormal. \\n3. Under any non-singular linear transformation of the coordinate system, \\nthe Mahalanobis distance keeps its quadratic form and remains positive \\ndefinite. Thus, after such a transformation, the distribution is again normal, \\nbut with different mean and covariance parameters. \\n4. The marginal densities of a normal distribution, obtained by integrating \\nout some of the variables, are themselves normal. Similarly, the conditional', \"densities, obtained by setting some of the variables to fixed values, are also \\nnormal. \\n5. There exists a linear transformation which diagonalizes the covariance ma\\xad\\ntrix. This leads to a new coordinate system, based on the eigenvectors of \\nS, in which the variables are statistically independent, so that the density \\nfunction for the vector x factors into the product of the densities for each \\nof the component variables separately (Exercise 2.2). \\n6. For given values of the mean and the covariance matrix, the normal den\\xad\\nsity function maximizes the entropy. This point is discussed further in \\nSection 6.10. 38 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nIn practice, the main reason for choosing a normal distribution is usually its \\nanalytical simplicity. \\n2.1.3 Discriminant functions \\nIn Section 1.9.1 we introduced the concept of a discriminant function, and showed \\nhow it could be related to the class-conditional density functions through Bayes'\", 'theorem. This led to a particular form of discriminant function given by \\nlfc(x) = lnp(x|Cfc) + lnP(C*) (2.11) \\nwhere Ck denotes the kth class, and P(Ck) denotes the corresponding prior prob\\xad\\nability. Each new input vector x is assigned to the class Cy. which gives the largest \\nvalue for the corresponding discriminant yk(x)- This choice of classification crite\\xad\\nrion minimizes the probability of misclassification. If each of the class-conditional \\ndensity functions p(x|Cfc) in (2.11) is taken to be an independent normal distri\\xad\\nbution, then from (2.4) we have \\n»*W = -\\\\{x - /ifc)TSfc x(x - Mfc) - ~ ln|E*| + lnP(Ck) (2.12) \\nwhere we have dropped constant terms. The decision boundaries, along which \\n«/k(x) = J/J(X), are therefore general quadratic functions in d-dimensional space. \\nAn important simplification occurs if the covariance matrices for the various \\nclasses are equal, so that Efc = E. Then the |Sfc| terms are class independent and', 'may be dropped from (2.12). Similarly, the quadratic term xTE~xx is also class \\nindependent and can be dropped. Since E is a symmetric matrix, its inverse must \\nalso be symmetric (Appendix A). It therefore follows that xTE_1/Xfc — ^E-1x. \\nThis gives a set of discriminant functions which can be written in the form \\nVk(x) = wjx + «/fco (2.13) \\nwhere \\nw^JiJS-1 (2.14) \\n«*o = --/ijfSTV* + In P(Ck) (2.15) \\nThe functions in (2.13) are an example of linear discriminants, since they are \\nlinear functions of x. Decision boundaries, corresponding to j/fc(x) = j/j(x), are \\nthen hyperplanar. This result is illustrated for a two-class problem with two \\nvariables, in which the two classes have equal covariance matrices, in Figure 2.3. \\nLinear discriminants are closely related to neural network models which have a \\nsingle layer of adaptive weights, as will be discussed in Section 3.1. \\nAnother simplification of the discriminant functions is possible if again the 2.2: Maximum likelihood 39', 'y,(*) = ^(x) \\nFigure 2.3. For two classes having normal probability densities with equal co-\\nvariance matrices, the decision boundary corresponding to the contour along \\nwhich the discriminant functions are equal, is linear. Here the ellipses corre\\xad\\nspond to contours of constant class-conditional density, while the straight line \\nrepresents the decision boundary which minimizes the probability of misclas-\\nsification for equal prior probabilities P(Ci) = P(C2). \\ncovariance matrices for all of the classes are equal, and in addition all of the \\nvariables are statistically independent, so that S becomes a diagonal matrix. \\nThen £ = cr2I (where I denotes the unit matrix) and the discriminant functions \\nin (2.12) can be written \\ny*(x) = -]-•Mfcll \\n2<72 + \\\\nP(Ck) (2.16) \\nwhere the class-independent term —dinIT has been dropped.

If the prior probabilities are not equal then this template matching rule \\nbecomes modified as indicated by (2.16). The concept of a prototype also arises \\nin connection with radial basis function networks, as discussed in Chapter 5. \\n2.2 Maximum likelihood \\nHaving decided on a parametric form for a density function p(x), the next stage is \\nto use the data set to find values for the parameters. In this section and the next \\nwe review briefly the two principal approaches to this problem, known respec\\xad\\ntively as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Although these methods \\noften lead to similar results, their conceptual basis is rather different. Maximum \\nlikelihood seeks to find the optimum values for the parameters by maximizing a', \"likelihood function derived from the training data. By contrast, in the Bayesian 40 2: Probability Density Estimation \\napproach the parameters are described by a probability distribution. This is \\ninitially set to some prior distribution, which is then converted to a posterior \\ndistribution, through the use of Bayes' theorem, once the data has been ob\\xad\\nserved. The final expression for the desired probability density of input variables \\nis then given by an integral over all possible values of the parameters, weighted \\nby their posterior distribution. Note that the Bayesian approach does not in\\xad\\nvolve setting the parameters to specific values, unlike the maximum likelihood \\nmethod. Since our aim in this chapter is to give an overview of conventional \\npattern recognition techniques, we shall restrict our attention to the case of the \\nnormal density function for which the results are relatively straightforward. \\nWe begin our discussion of parameter estimation by considering the maximum\", 'likelihood procedure. Suppose we consider a density function p(x) which depends \\non a set of parameters 9 = {9\\\\,..., 8M)T- In a classification problem we would \\ntake one such function for each of the classes. Here we shall omit the class labels \\nfor simplicity, but essentially the same steps are performed separately for each \\nclass in the problem. To make the dependence on the parameters explicit, we \\nshall write the density function in the form p(x|0). We also have a data set of \\nN vectors X = {x1,..., xN}. If these vectors are drawn independently from the \\ndistribution p(x|0), then the joint probability density of the whole data set X is \\ngiven by \\nN \\nP(x\\\\9)^l{p(^\\\\e)^c(e) (2.17) \\nwhere £(0) can be viewed as a function of 0 for fixed X, in which case it is \\nreferred to as the likelihood of 0 for the given X. The technique of maximum \\nlikelihood then sets the value of 0 by maximizing C{6). This corresponds to the', 'intuitively reasonable idea of choosing the 0 which is most likely to give rise to the \\nobserved data. A more formal discussion of the origins of the maximum likelihood \\nprocedure is given in Akaike (1973). In practice, it is often more convenient to \\nconsider the negative logarithm of the likelihood \\nN \\n£ = -ln£(0) = -]Tlnp(xn|0) (2.18) \\nn=l \\nand to find a minimum of E. This is equivalent to maximizing C since the negative \\nlogarithm is a monotonically decreasing function. The negative log-likelihood can \\nbe regarded as an error function, as discussed at greater length in Chapter 6. \\nFor most choices of density function, the optimum 0 will have to be found by \\nan iterative numerical procedure of the kind described in Chapter 7. However, \\nfor the special case of a multivariate normal density, we can find the maximum \\nlikelihood solution by analytic differentiation of (2.18), with p(x|0) given by', '(2.4). Some straightforward but rather involved matrix algebra (Anderson, 1958; 2.2: Maximum likelihood 41 \\nTatsuoka, 1971) then leads to the following results \\nM=^X>\" (219) \\nn=l \\n£ = jf X>\" - £KX\" - &T (2-2°) n—1 \\nwhich represents the intuitive result that the maximum likelihood estimate p, of \\nthe mean vector /i is given by the sample average (i.e. the average with respect to \\nthe given data set). We recall from (2.5) that, for data generated from a normal \\ndistribution, the expectation of x (i.e. the average value of x over an infinite \\nsample) gives the true mean (i. Similarly, the maximum likelihood estimate £ \\nof the covariance matrix £ is given by the sample average of the outer product \\n(x\" — fx)(xn — /i)T. Again, from (2.6), we note that, for data generated from \\na normal distribution, the expectation of this quantity (with fi, replaced by fj.) \\ngives the true covariance matrix S. \\nAlthough the maximum likelihood approach seems intuitively reasonable, we', 'should point out that it can suffer from some deficiencies. Consider the maximum \\nlikelihood estimates for the mean and variance of a normal distribution in one \\ndimension, given from (2.19) and (2.20), by \\n1 N \\n3 =#!>\".

An estimate such as this, whose expected value differs from the true \\nvalue, is said to exhibit bias. In the limit N —> oo, we see that the bias disappears, \\nand indeed for moderate values of N the maximum likelihood estimator gives \\na reasonable approximation. The problem has arisen because, in the expression \\n(2.22) for a2, we have used our estimate p for the mean, rather than the true \\nvalue fi.

Once we \\nhave observed the data set X, we can calculate the corresponding posterior \\ndistribution using Bayes' theorem. Since some values of the parameter will be \\nmore consistent with the data than others, this leads to posterior distribution \\nwhich is narrower than the prior distribution. \\nin neural networks. In this case the consequences are potentially much more \\nserious, as a result of the much larger number of parameters which have to be \\ndetermined. \\n2.3 Bayesian inference \\nIn the maximum likelihood method described above, the goal is to find the \\nsingle most likely value for the parameter vector 0 given the observed data. The \\nBayesian approach, however, is rather different. Our uncertainty in the values\", \"of the parameters is represented by a probability density function, as discussed \\nin Section 1.8.2. Before we observe the data, the parameters are described by a \\nprior probability density, which is typically very broad to reflect the fact that \\nwe have little idea of what values the parameters should take. Once we observe \\nthe data, we can make use of Bayes' theorem to find the corresponding posterior \\nprobability density. Since some values of the parameters are more consistent with \\nthe data than others, we find that the posterior distribution is narrower than \\nthe prior distribution. This phenomenon is known as Bayesian learning, and is \\nillustrated schematically in Figure 2.4. \\nWe first give a formal discussion of Bayesian learning in general terms, and \\nthen consider a very simple example to see how it operates in practice. In Chap\\xad\\nter 10 we apply Bayesian techniques to the much more complex problems of\", \"determining the parameters in a neural network, and of comparing different net\\xad\\nwork models. \\nWe begin by writing the desired density function for the vector x, given the \\ntraining data set X, as an integral over a joint distribution of the form \\np(x\\\\X)= fp(x,0\\\\X)dO. (2.24) 2.3: Bayesian inference 43 \\nFrom the definition of conditional probability densities, we can then write \\np(x, 9\\\\X) = p(x|0, X)p(0\\\\X). (2.25) \\nThe first factor, however, is independent of X since it is just our assumed form \\nfor the parametrized density, and is completely specified once the values of the \\nparameters 9 have been set. We therefore have \\np{x\\\\X)= fp(x\\\\0)p(9\\\\X)d0. (2.26) \\nThus, instead of choosing a specific value for 6, the Bayesian approach performs \\na weighted average over all values of 9. The weighting factor p(0\\\\X), which is the \\nposterior distribution of 6, is determined by starting from some assumed prior \\ndistribution p(9) and then updating it using Bayes' theorem to take account of\", \"the data set X. Since the data points {x1,... ,xN} are assumed to be drawn \\nindependently from the same underlying distribution, we can write \\nN \\np(X\\\\0)=:l[p(xn\\\\e) (2.27) \\nwhich is precisely the likelihood function introduced in (2.17). Using Bayes' the\\xad\\norem we can then write the posterior distribution for 6 in the form \\nmx)=mn=m.^m (2,28) \\nwhere the normalization factor in the denominator is given by \\n( N \\nPW= P{e')l[p{xn\\\\e')de' (2.29) \\nand ensures that fp(0\\\\X)dO = 1. Typically, the evaluation of integrals such \\nas (2.26) and (2.29) is a very complex undertaking, and, in general, it is only \\nanalytically feasible for the class of density functions for which the posterior \\ndensity in (2.28) has the same functional form as the prior. For a given choice \\nof density p(x\\\\0), a prior p{9) which gives rise to a posterior p(9\\\\X) having the \\nsame functional form is said to be a conjugate prior. If we were to update the\", 'distribution of 9 using a succession of data points, with the posterior at each \\nstage forming the prior at the next stage, then the distribution would retain \\nthe same functional form throughout. Such functions are known as reproducing \\ndensities (Duda and Hart, 1973), and include the normal distribution as the 44 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nmost commonly encountered example. \\nIn order to illustrate the technique of Bayesian learning, we consider a simple \\nexample involving a one-dimensional input space governed by a single variable \\nx. We shall suppose that the data is generated from a normal distribution for \\nwhich the standard deviation a is assumed to be known. The goal is to find the \\nmean /J. of the distribution, given a set of data points {a;1,..., xN}. We shall take \\nthe prior density for /i to be a normal distribution having mean /io and standard \\ndeviation <7o, given by \\nThis expresses our prior knowledge of the mean n, and so if we are very uncertain', \"as to its value we would choose a large value for <TQ. Once we have observed a \\ngiven set of N data points, we can calculate the posterior density p(ji\\\\X) = \\nPN{IAXI-> • • • <XN) using Bayes' theorem. It is important to distinguish clearly \\nbetween the distribution of x, which we are trying to model, and the distributions \\nPo(fi) and PM(^\\\\X), which describe our uncertainty in the value of ji. In this \\nparticular example, all of these distributions are normal. \\nUsing (2.28) we can write the posterior distribution in the form \\nPn(n\\\\X) = $$f[p(x»\\\\n). (2.31) \\nThen, using the form (2.1) for the normal distribution for p(x\\\\fj), it is straight\\xad\\nforward to show (Exercise 2.5) that the posterior distribution p^(p\\\\X) is also \\nnormal, with mean fj,^ and variance crjy given by \\n^ = TM^^N£^^ (2-32) \\nwhere x is the sample mean N 1 \\n= ~2 + -2 (2-33) \\n-^E*n- (2-34) N \\nProm (2.32) and (2.33) we see that, as the number of data points JV increases,\", 'the mean of the posterior distribution for /J approaches the sample mean x. \\nSimilarly, the standard deviation ax approaches zero. This result is illustrated \\nfor a particular set of parameter values in Figure 2.5. 2.3: Bayesian inference 45 \\n10.0 \\n5.0 \\n0.0 -\\nN = 0 • •—i • \\nW=5oA \\nN= 10/T\\\\ I \\nN=l / / M \\n0.0 0.5 H 1.0 \\nFigure 2.5. An illustration of Bayesian inference for the case of data drawn \\nfrom a normal density function. The plot shows the posterior density for the \\nmean ft, which is itself also given by a normal distribution in this example. As \\nthe number N of data points increases, the posterior density becomes more \\nsharply peaked. In this example, the prior distribution was chosen to have a \\nmean of 0.0 and standard deviation of 0.3 to reflect the fact that we have little \\nidea of what value /* should have. The true mean of the distribution of x from \\nwhich the data was generated, was 0.8 (with a standard deviation of 0.3 which', 'is assumed to be known). Note that, as the size N of the sample increases, the \\nposterior distribution concentrates around the true value of the mean. \\nThere is a simple relationship between the technique of Bayesian inference \\nand the maximum likelihood method. From (2.17) and (2.28) we have, omitting \\nthe denominator since it is independent of 0, \\np(e\\\\x1,...,xN)cx£(0)p(0). (2.35) \\nIf we have little prior information about 0 then p(0) will be relatively flat. The \\nlikelihood function by definition peaks at the maximum likelihood value 0. If \\nthe peak is relatively sharp, then the integral in (2.26) will be dominated by the \\nregion around 0, and the integral in (2.26) will be given approximately by \\np(x\\\\X) ~ p(x\\\\8) JV{0\\\\X) dO = p{x\\\\d) (2.36) \\nwhere we have used fp(0\\\\X)dd = 1. Thus, the distribution is just given by \\nthe maximum likelihood expression. We have seen that, as the number N of \\nobservations increases, the posterior probability density for 0 tends to become', 'more and more sharply peaked. For large numbers of observations, therefore, the \\nBayesian representation of the density p(x) approaches the maximum likelihood 46 S: Probability Density Estimation \\nsolution. For a limited number of observations, however, the two approaches will \\ntend to give somewhat different results. \\n2.4 Sequential parameter estimation \\nThere are several other approaches to the problem of parameter estimation, \\nwhich we do not have space to discuss in detail here. One technique which is \\nworthy of mention, however, is that of sequential parameter estimation, since it \\nunderpins a number of algorithms used in adaptive neural networks. \\nSequential methods for parameter estimation make use of iterative techniques \\nto update the parameter values as new data points or observations are acquired. \\nThey play an important role in pattern recognition for a number of reasons. First, \\nthey do not require the storage of a complete data set since each data point can', \"be discarded once it has been used, and so they can prove useful when large \\nvolumes of data are available. Second, they can be used for 'on-line' learning in \\nreal-time adaptive systems. Finally, if the underlying process which generates \\nthe data has a slow time variation, the parameter values can adapt to 'track' the \\nbehaviour of the system. \\nIn simple cases it may be possible to take a standard 'batch' technique for \\nparameter estimation and separate out the contribution from the (N + l)th \\ndata point to give a sequential update formula. For instance, from the maximum \\nlikelihood expression for the mean of a normal distribution, given by (2.19), we \\nobtain \\nM*+I=£N + -^(XVV+1-£;V). (2.37) \\nWe see that it is only necessary to store the values of fi, and N, and so each data \\npoint is used once and can then be discarded. Note that the contribution of each \\nsuccessive data point decreases as a consequence of the l/(N + 1) coefficient.\", 'Although this heuristic procedure seems reasonable, we would like to find some \\nformal assurance that it will converge satisfactorily. To do this, we turn to a \\nmore general view of sequential parameter estimation. \\n2.4.1 The Robbins-Monro algorithm \\nThe iterative formula of (2.37) is a particular example of a more general proce\\xad\\ndure for finding the roots of functions which are defined stochastically. Consider a \\npair of random variables g and 0 which are correlated, as indicated in Figure 2.6. \\nThe average value of g for each value of 0 defines a function f(0) \\nf(0) = em (2.38) \\nwhere S[\\\\9\\\\ denotes the expectation for the given value of 0. Thus, if we could \\nmake several measurements of the value of g for a given value of 6 we would obtain \\na set of random values whose average value (in the limit of an infinite sample) \\ndefines the value of the function / at that value of 0. Functions which have this S.4: Sequential parameter estimation M \\n/(O)', 'Figure 2.6. The regression function f(0) is defined to be the expectation of a \\nrandom variable g for each value of 9. The root 6* of f(0) can be found by the \\nRobbins-Monro algorithm. \\ngeneral form are referred to as regression functions, and a general procedure for \\nfinding the roots of such functions was given by Robbins and Monro (1951). \\nThe goal is to find a value 9* for which /(#*) = 0.

The dashed line represent the regres\\xad\\nsion function (fi — /I)/CT2, and its root gives the required maximum likelihood \\nestimate jl of the mean in the limit of an infinite set of data. \\nThis is a very straightforward scheme to implement, once we have chosen a \\nfunctional form for the density p(x\\\\0). \\nAs a specific example, consider the case where p(x\\\\6) is taken to be a normal \\ndistribution, with known standard deviation a and unknown mean fx. It is then \\na few lines of algebra (Exercise 2.6) to show that, if we choose a/v = a2/(N+ 1), \\nwe recover the one-dimensional version of (2.37). This choice of O,N satisfies the \\ncriteria (2.41) - (2.43), and so convergence is assured. In this case, the random \\nvariable 9 of Figure 2.6 is given by the estimate (7 of the mean, and the random \\nvariable g is given by (x — fi)/a2.

We begin with a discussion of \\nsimple histogram methods, and then move onto kernel-based approaches which, \\nas discussed in Chapter 5, have a close connection with radial basis function \\nneural networks.

Determination of suitable values for such parameters is an important', 'part of the density estimation process. \\n2.5.1 Histograms \\nThe basic problem of non-parametric density estimation is very simple. Given a \\nset of data points, we wish to model the probability distribution which generated \\nthe data, without making any prior assumption about the form of the distribution \\nfunction (except for some general smoothness properties, which we shall discuss \\nshortly). In Section 1.1 we considered a histogram of hypothetical values for a \\nfeature x\\\\ for each of two classes. The histogram is obtained simply by dividing \\nthe rci-axis into a number of bins, and approximating the density at each value \\nof xi by the fraction of the points which fall inside the corresponding bin. This \\nprocedure represents a simple form of non-parametric density estimation. \\nIn Figure 2.8 we show a simple example of density estimation using the \\nhistogram approach. Note that we can choose both the number of bins M, and S.5: Non-parametric methods 51', 'their starting position on the axis. The results are often not too sensitive to the \\nstarting position, but the parameter M plays a crucial role. Figure 2.8 shows the \\nhistograms which result from values of M of 3, 7 and 22. We see that the number \\nof bins (or more precisely the bin width) is acting as a smoothing parameter. If \\nthe bin width is too small then the estimated density is very spiky, while if its \\nvalue is too large then some of the true structure in the density (in this case the \\nbimodal nature of the distribution) is smoothed out. In general we expect there to \\nbe some optimum value for the bin width which represents the best compromise \\nbetween these problems. This situation is closely related to that encountered in \\nSection 1.5 in the context of curve fitting with polynomials. There we saw the \\nimportance of choosing a suitable number of terms in the polynomial in order \\nto capture the underlying structure in the data, without over-fitting to the noise', 'on the individual data points. Similarly, in the case of density estimation, we do \\nnot know the true underlying density, and so we are faced with the problem of \\nhow to choose a suitable value for the parameter M. We shall see that this is \\na key issue which will arise in a number of different guises, both in the context \\nof conventional techniques and of neural networks. For the moment we defer the \\nproblem of finding the optimal value for parameters such as M while we examine \\nalternative approaches to non-parametric density estimation. \\nOne advantage of the histogram method is that, once the histogram has been \\nconstructed, the data can be discarded and only the information on the sizes and \\nlocations of the histogram bins need be retained. (In this sense, the histogram \\nrepresentation should strictly be regarded as a semi-parametric technique). In\\xad\\ndeed, the histogram may be constructed sequentially in which data points are', \"considered one at a time and then discarded. The benefits of sequential tech\\xad\\nniques were discussed in Section 2.4. However, the simple histogram suffers from \\na number of difficulties which make it unsuitable for use in most practical ap\\xad\\nplications, except for rapid visualization of data in one or two dimensions. One \\nproblem is that the estimated density function is not smooth but has discon\\xad\\ntinuities at the boundaries of the histogram bins. Since these boundaries were \\nselected by hand in advance of observing the data, it is unlikely that they repre\\xad\\nsent true structure in the distribution. A second very serious problem becomes \\napparent when we consider the generalization to higher dimensions. If we divide \\neach variable into M intervals, then a d-dimensional feature space will be di\\xad\\nvided into Md bins. This exponential growth with d is an example of the 'curse \\nof dimensionality' discussed in Section 1.4. In high dimensions we would either\", \"require a huge number of data points to obtain a density estimate, or most of \\nthe bins would be empty, corresponding to an estimated density of zero. \\n2.5.2 Density estimation in general \\nSo far we have given a rather heuristic discussion of density estimation based on \\nthe idea of histograms. To proceed further we return to the basic definition of \\nprobability density functions. The probability that a new vector x, drawn from \\nthe unknown density function p(x), will fall inside some region 11 of x-space is, \\nby definition, given by 52 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nI P(x') Jn dx'. (2.49) \\nIf we have N data points drawn independently from p(x) then the probability \\nthat K of them will fall within the region 71 is given by the binomial law \\nPriK^mN-KVPK(l-P)N~K- (2-50) \\nThe mean fraction of points falling in this regions is given by £[K/N] = P and \\nthe variance around this mean is given by £[(K/N - P)2) — P(l - P)/N. Thus\", \"the distribution is sharply peaked as N —» oo. We therefore expect that a good \\nestimate of the probability P can be obtained from the mean fraction of the \\npoints which fall within 71, so that \\nP ~ K/N. (2.51) \\nIf we assume that p(x) is continuous and does not vary appreciably over the \\nregion 71, then we can approximate (2.49) by \\nP= f p(x') dx' ~ p(x) V (2.52) \\nJn \\nwhere V is the volume of 71, and x is some point lying inside 71. Prom (2.51) \\nand (2.52) we obtain the intuitive result \\nK*)-~. (2-53) \\nNote that to obtain this estimate we have had to make two assumptions, the \\nvalidity of which is governed by the choice of the region 71. In order for (2.51) to \\nhold accurately we require 71 to be relatively large, so that P will be large and \\nthe binomial distribution will be sharply peaked. However, the approximation in \\n(2.52) is most accurate when 71 is relatively small, so that p(x) is approximately\", 'constant inside the integration region. Once again, we see that there is a choice \\nto be made regarding the degree of smoothing to be performed, and for a given \\nsize of data set we expect that there will be some optimum value for the size \\nof 71 which will give the best estimate of p(x). We shall return to this problem \\nshortly. \\nIn applying (2.53) to practical density estimation problems there are two \\nbasic approaches we can adopt. The first is to choose a fixed value of K and \\ndetermine the corresponding volume V from the data. This gives rise to the K-\\nnearest-neighbour approach discussed later. Alternatively we can fix the volume \\nV and determine K from the data. This leads to the class of kernel-based density \\nestimation techniques, which we describe next. 2.5: Non-parametric methods 53 \\nWe expect that, in the limit of an infinite number of data points, our esti\\xad\\nmation procedure should become exact, since the volume of 1i- can be shrunk', 'to zero, thereby ensuring that (2.52) becomes increasingly accurate, while also \\nimproving the accuracy of (2.51) by ensuring that 71 contains an ever increasing \\nnumber of points. It can be shown that both kernel methods and if-nearest-\\nneighbour methods do indeed converge to the true probability density in the \\nlimit of infinite TV, provided that V shrinks with N, and K grows with N, in a \\nsuitable way (Duda and Hart, 1973). \\n2.5.3 Kernel-based methods \\nSuppose we take the region ft to be a hypercube with sides of length h centred \\non the point x. Its volume is then given by \\nV = hd. (2.54) \\nWe can find an expression for K, the number of points which fall within this \\nregion, by defining a kernel junction H(u), also known as a Parzen window \\n(Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) given by \\n\"<«)-{; Jai^r j=1 \\' <\"•> so that H(u) corresponds to a unit hypercube centred at the origin. Thus, for \\nall data points x\", the quantity H((x. — xn)/h) is equal to unity if the point x\"', \"falls inside a hypercube of side h centred on x, and is zero otherwise. The total \\nnumber of points falling inside the hypercube is then simply \\n*=i>04^)- (2-56) n=l ^ ' \\nIf we substitute (2.56) and (2.54) into (2.53) we obtain the following estimate \\nfor the density at the point x: \\nwhere p(x) denotes the model density. We can regard this density estimate as \\nconsisting of the superposition of N cubes of side h, with each cube centred \\non one of the data points. This is somewhat reminiscent of the histogram ap\\xad\\nproach, except that, instead of bins which are defined in advance, we have cells \\nwhose locations are determined by the data points. Nevertheless, we still have \\nan estimate which has discontinuities. \\nWe can smooth out the estimate by choosing different forms for the kernel 54 S: Probability Density Estimation \\nfunction H(u). For instance, a common choice is a multivariate normal kernel, \\nfor which \\n**>=]vg (2^wexpr^^/ (2-58) \\nIn general, if the kernel functions satisfy\", 'H(u) > 0 (2.59) \\nand \\n/#(u)du = l (2.60) \\nthen the estimate in (2.57) will satisfy p(x) > 0 and fp(x)dx — 1, as required. \\nAs a simple example of kernel density estimation, we return to the data \\nset used to construct the histograms of Figure 2.8. In Figure 2.9 we plot the \\nresults of density estimation using a Gaussian kernel function, with values of the \\nwidth parameter h given by 0.2, 0.08 and 0.01 respectively. This shows that h is \\nacting as a smoothing parameter, and that an appropriate choice for the value \\nof h is important if a good approximation to the true density is to be obtained. \\nWhen the kernel width h is too large the estimated density is over-smoothed \\nand the bimodal nature of the underlying distribution is lost. Conversely, when \\nh is too small, a great deal of structure is present in the estimated density which \\nrepresents the properties of the particular data set rather than true structure in \\nthe underlying distribution.', 'Some insight into the role of the kernel function can be obtained by computing \\nthe expectation of the estimated density, in other words the average value of the \\nmodel density at some given point x, where the average is taken over different \\npossible selections of the data points x\". Making use of (2.57) we have \\nn=l L v \\' J \\nwhere, in the third line, we have used the fact that the vectors xn are drawn \\nindependently from the density p{x), and so the expectation is simply given by an 2.5: Non-parametric methods 55 \\n(a) h = 0.2 \\n(b) h = 0.08 \\nh = 0.01 \\nFigure 2.9. An example of the kernel approach to density estimation, using \\nthe same data as in Figure 2.8. Gaussian kernel functions have been used with \\nvarious values for the kernel width h. \\nintegral weighted by this density. We see that the expectation of the estimated \\ndensity is a convolution of the true density with the kernel function, and so \\nrepresents a smoothed version of the true density. Here the kernel width h plays', 'the role of the smoothing parameter. For /i —• 0, the kernel approaches a delta \\nfunction and p(x) approaches the true density. For a finite sample size, however, \\na small value of h leads to a noisy representation for p(x) which approaches a set \\nof delta functions centred on the data points. Once again, we see that we must \\nchoose a compromise value for the smoothing parameter h. \\nThe kernel-based method suffers from the drawback of requiring all of the \\ndata points to be stored, which can make evaluation of the density very slow if \\nthe number of data points is large. One solution is to use fewer kernel functions \\nand to adapt their positions and widths in response to the data. Methods for \\ndoing this, based on maximum likelihood, will be described in Section 2.6. \\nAnother problem with the kernel-based estimator is that it gives a biased es\\xad\\ntimate of the density. In fact, Rosenblatt (1956) showed that, for a finite data set,', 'there is no non-negative estimator which is unbiased for all continuous density \\nfunctions. \\nThe use of kernel methods to estimate regression functions is discussed in \\nChapter 5, which also demonstrates the close link with radial basis function \\nnetworks. \\n2.5.4 K-nearest-neighbours \\nOne of the potential problems with the kernel-based approach to density estima\\xad\\ntion arises from the use of a fixed width parameter h for all of the data points. 56 2: Probability Density Estimation \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n*M \\n——C\"* \\n(c) 1 II1 \\n/ niiv \\\\ \\n*^fc _ ^ P» \\' \\n*\\\\> y £=20 \\n... - * .. \\nK=Q \\n*££ZZj\\\\%^ \"^ \\' ***i \\nAT=1 \\n*\\\\ J\\\\J\\\\ % w \\nFigure 2.10. The AT-nearest-neighbour approach to density estimation, again \\nusing the same data as in Figure 2.8, for various values of K. \\nIf h is too large there may be regions of x-space in which the estimate is over-\\nsmoothed. Reducing h may, however, lead to problems in regions of lower density \\nwhere the model density p will become noisy. Thus, the optimum choice of h may', 'be a function of position. This difficulty is addressed in the if-nearest-neighbour \\napproach to density estimation. \\nWe again return to (2.53) as our starting point, but we now fix K and allow \\nthe volume V to vary. Thus, we consider a small hypersphere centred at a point \\nx, and allow the radius of the sphere to grow until it contains precisely K data \\npoints. The estimate of the density at the point x is then given by (2.53), where \\nV is the volume of the sphere. In Figure 2.10 we show the result of the if-nearest-\\nneighbour approach, for the same data set as used in Figures 2.8 and 2.9, for the \\nvalues K = 20, 8 and 1. We see that K acts as a smoothing parameter and that \\nthere is an optimum choice for the value of K. \\nOne disadvantage of the iiT-nearest-neighbour technique is that the resulting \\nestimate is not a true probability density since its integral over all x-space di\\xad\\nverges. A disadvantage of both kernel and iiT-nearest-neighbour methods is that', \"all of the training data points must be retained. This might lead to problems of \\ncomputer storage, and can require large amounts of processing to evaluate the \\ndensity for new values of x. More sophisticated versions of these algorithms al\\xad\\nlow fewer data points to be used (Hart, 1968; Gates, 1972; Hand and Batchelor, \\n1978). There also exist tree search techniques which speed up the process finding \\nthe near neighbours of a point (Fukunaga and Narendra, 1975). \\nAs we have already indicated, one of the applications of density estimation is \\nin the construction of classifiers through the use of Bayes' theorem. This involves 2.5: Non-parametric methods 57 \\nmodelling the class-conditional densities for each class separately, and then com\\xad\\nbining them with priors to give models for the posterior probabilities which can \\nthen be used to make classification decisions. We can use this approach to find a \\nclassifier based directly on the if-nearest-neighbour technique by the following\", \"slight modification. Suppose our data set contains Nk points in class Ck and N \\npoints in total, so that Y^k ^k = N- We then draw a hypersphere around the \\npoint x which encompasses K points irrespective of their class label. Suppose \\nthis sphere, of volume V, contains Kk points from class Ck- Then we can use \\n(2.53) to give approximations for the class-conditional densities in the form \\nP(x\\\\Ck) = —?• (2.62) \\nThe unconditional density can be similarly estimated from \\nP(x) = ^ (2.63) \\nwhile the priors can be estimated using \\nm) = 7p (2-64) \\nWe now use Bayes' theorem to give \\np{Ck]x) ~ —K3 ~ T- (2-65) \\nThus, to minimize the probability of misclassifying a new vector x, it should \\nbe assigned to the class Ck for which the ratio Kk/K is largest. This is known \\nas the K-nearest-neighbour classification rule. It involves finding a hypersphere \\naround the point x which contains K points (independent of their class), and\", 'then assigning x to the class having the largest number of representatives inside \\nthe hypersphere. For the special case of K = 1 we have the nearest-neighbour \\nrule, which simply assigns a point x to the same class as that of the nearest point \\nfrom the training set. Figure 2.11 shows an example of the decision boundary \\ncorresponding to the nearest-neighbour classification rule. \\n2.5.5 Smoothing parameters \\nFor all of the density estimation techniques discussed in this section we have seen \\nthat there is always some form of smoothing parameter governing the nature of \\nthe estimated density. For histograms it is the width of the bins, for kernel \\nmethods it is the kernel width h, and for iV-nearest-neighbours it is the value of \\nK. If the model density is over-smoothed, the bias becomes large and leads to a \\nrelatively poor estimator. However, with insufficient smoothing the variance is 58 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nX2 \\nX,', 'Figure 2.11. Example of the decision boundary produced by the nearest-\\nneighbour classification rule. Note that the boundary is piecewise linear, with \\neach segment corresponding to the perpendicular bisector between two data \\npoints belonging to different classes. \\nhigh, so that the model density is noisy and very sensitive to the individual data \\npoints. (Bias and variance are defined more precisely in Section 9.1). The choice \\nof a suitable value for the smoothing parameter is analogous to the problem of \\nchoosing the number of terms in a polynomial used in curve fitting, discussed \\nin Section 1.5. Similar smoothing parameters will appear in our discussions of \\nneural networks. For instance, the number of hidden units in a layered feed\\xad\\nforward network can play a similar role to the number of terms in a polynomial. \\nIt is important to realize that we cannot simply pick the value of the smooth\\xad\\ning parameter which gives the largest value for the likelihood, as the likelihood', \"can always be increased indefinitely by choosing ever smaller values for the \\nsmoothing parameter. Consider for instance the case of kernel estimators. The \\nlikelihood function can be written as \\nN \\nC(h)= J]p(xn|h;x1,...xw) (2.66) \\nn=l \\nwhere p(x|...) is given by (2.58) for the case of Gaussian kernels. It is easily \\nverified that unconstrained maximization of C(h) leads to h —• 0 so that the \\nresulting density estimate consists of a delta function at each data point, with \\nzero density elsewhere. \\nThe goal in selecting smoothing parameters is to produce a model for the \\nprobability density which is as close as possible to the (unknown) true den\\xad\\nsity p(x). It is often convenient to have a formal measure of the difference, or \\n'distance', between two density functions. If p(x) is our model of the density \\nfunction, then the average negative log-likelihood per data point, in the limit as 2.6: Mixture models 59\", \"the number of data points goes to infinity, can be written as an expectation in \\nthe form \\ni N \\n£ [- ln£] = - Im^ - £ lnp(x») (2.67) \\nn=l \\n= - J p(x)lnp(x) dx (2.68) \\nwhich can be regarded as a measure of the extent to which the model density \\nand the true density agree. When p(x) = p(x) this measure has a residual value \\ngiven by \\n- j p(x) In p(x)dx (2.69) \\nwhich is known as the entropy of p(x) (Section 6.10). It is convenient to subtract \\noff this residual value to give a measure of the 'distance' between p(x) and p(x) \\nin the form \\n•/PW In^dx (2.70) \\np(x) \\nwhich is known as the Kullback-Leibler distance or asymmetric divergence (Kull-\\nback and Leibler, 1951; Kullback, 1959). It is easily shown (Exercise 2.10) that \\nL > 0 with equality if, and only if, the two density functions are equal. Note \\nthat L is not symmetric with respect to the two probability distributions. This is \\nreasonable since it is more important for the model distribution p(x) to be close\", 'to the true distribution p(x) in regions where data is more likely to be found. \\nThus the integral in (2.70) is weighted by the true distribution. \\nIn a practical density estimation problem we are therefore faced with the \\ndifficulty of deciding a suitable value for the smoothing parameter. This is an \\nexample of a very general, and very important, issue which is concerned with \\nchoosing the optimal level of complexity, or flexibility, of a model for a given \\ndata set. Rather than consider this problem in the framework of density estima\\xad\\ntion, we defer further discussion until Chapters 9 and 10, where we consider the \\nanalogous issue in the context of neural network models. There we shall discuss \\ntwo general approaches for dealing with model complexity, based respectively on \\ncross-validation and Bayesian inference. \\n2.6 Mixture models \\nSo far in this chapter we have considered two general approaches to density', 'estimation, parametric and non parametric, each of which has its merits and \\nlimitations. In particular, the parametric approach assumes a specific form for 60 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nthe density function, which might be very different from the true density. Usually, \\nhowever, parametric models allow the density function to be evaluated very \\nrapidly for new values of the input vector. Non-parametric methods, by contrast, \\nallow very general forms of density function, but suffer from the fact that the \\nnumber of variables in the model grows directly with the number of training data \\npoints. This leads to models which can be very slow to evaluate for new input \\nvectors. \\nIn order to combine the advantages of both parametric and non-parametric \\nmethods we need to find techniques which are not restricted to specific functional \\nforms, and yet where the size of the model only grows with the complexity of', 'the problem being solved, and not simply with the size of the data set. This \\nleads us to a class of models which we shall call semi-parametric. The price we \\nhave to pay is that the process of setting up the model using the data set (i.e. \\nthe training of the model) is computationally intensive compared to the simple \\nprocedures needed for parametric or non-parametric methods (which in some \\ncases involve little more than evaluating a few expressions for parameter values, \\nor even just storing the training data). \\nIn this section we shall restrict attention to one particular form of density \\nfunction, called a mixture model. As well as providing powerful techniques for \\ndensity estimation, mixture models find important applications in the context \\nof neural networks, for example in configuring the basis functions in radial basis \\nfunction networks (Section 5.9), in techniques for conditional density estimation', '(Section 6.4), in the technique of soft weight sharing (Section 9.4), and in the \\nmixture-of-experts model (Section 9.7). Here we discuss three training methods \\nfor mixture models, all of which are based on maximum likelihood, involving \\nrespectively non-linear optimization, re-estimation (leading to the EM algorithm) \\nand stochastic sequential estimation. \\nIn the non-parametric kernel-based approach to density estimation, the den\\xad\\nsity function was represented as a linear superposition of kernel functions, with \\none kernel centred on each data point. Here we consider models in which the den\\xad\\nsity function is again formed from a linear combination of basis functions, but \\nwhere the number M of basis functions is treated as a parameter of the model \\nand is typically much less than the number N of data points. We therefore write \\nour model for the density as a linear combination of component densities p(x\\\\j) \\nin the form \\nM \\np(x) = £>(x|j)P(j). (2.71) \\n3=1', 'Such a representation is called a mixture distribution (Titterington et al., 1985; \\nMcLachlan and Basford, 1988) and the coefficients P(j) are called the mixing \\nparameters. Notice that there is a strong similarity between (2.71) and the ex\\xad\\npression given in equation (1.22) for the unconditional density of data taken from \\na mixture of several classes. This similarity has been emphasized by our choice of 2.6: Mixture models 61 \\nnotation. We shall call P(j) the prior probability of the data point having been \\ngenerated from component j of the mixture. These priors are chosen to satisfy \\nthe constraints \\nM \\n$>0) = 1 (2.72) \\n0 < P(j) < 1. (2.73) \\nSimilarly, the component density functions p(x\\\\j) are normalized so that \\nfp(x\\\\j)dx=l (2.74) \\nand hence can be regarded as class-conditional densities. To generate a data \\npoint from the probability distribution (2.71), one of the components j is first \\nselected at random with probability P(j), and then a data point is generated', \"from the corresponding component density p(xjj). An important property of such \\nmixture models is that, for many choices of component density function, they can \\napproximate any continuous density to arbitrary accuracy provided the model \\nhas a sufficiently large number of components, and provided the parameters of \\nthe model are chosen correctly. \\nThe key difference between the mixture model representation and a true \\nclassification problem lies in the nature of the training data, since in this case we \\nare not provided with any 'class labels' to say which component was responsible \\nfor generating each data point. This represents an example of incomplete data, \\nand we shall discuss this problem at greater length when we consider the EM \\nalgorithm in Section 2.6.2. As with any of the other density estimation techniques \\ndiscussed in this chapter, the technique of mixture modelling can be applied \\nseparately to each class Ck in a true classification problem. In this case, each\", \"class-conditional density p(x|Cfc) is represented by an independent mixture model \\nof the form (2.71). \\nHaving made the link with prior probabilities and conditional densities, we \\ncan introduce the corresponding posterior probabilities, which we can express \\nusing Bayes' theorem in the form \\nPOIx) = ^gP (2-75) \\nwhere p(x) is given by (2.71). These posterior probabilities satisfy \\nM \\n£P0'M = 1. (2.76) 62 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nP« \\nFigure 2.12. Representation of the mixture model (2.71) in terms of a network \\ndiagram. For Gaussian component densities p(x|j) given by (2.77), the lines \\nconnecting the inputs xi to the components p(x\\\\j) represent the elements \\\\Xji \\nof the corresponding mean vectors fij. \\nThe value of P(j\\\\x) represents the probability that a particular component j \\nwas responsible for generating the data point x. \\nIn this section, we shall limit our attention to mixture models in which the\", 'individual component densities are given by Gaussian distribution functions. We \\nshall further assume that the Gaussians each have a covariance matrix which is \\nsome scalar multiple of the identity matrix so that £/ = cr?I (where I is the \\nidentity matrix) and hence \\nIn fact, the techniques we shall describe are easily extended to general Gaussian \\ncomponent densities having full covariance matrices as discussed in Section 2.1.1 \\nin the context of parametric distributions. \\nThe mixture model can be represented in terms of a network diagram as \\nshown in Figure 2.12. This is simply a diagrammatic representation of a mathe\\xad\\nmatical function, in this case the mixture model in (2.71). Such diagrams prove \\nparticularly useful when considering complex neural network structures, as dis\\xad\\ncussed in later chapters. \\n2.6.1 Maximum likelihood \\nVarious procedures have been developed for determining the parameters of a \\nGaussian mixture model from a set of data. In the remainder of this chapter we', 'consider three approaches, all of them based on maximizing the likelihood of the \\nparameters for the given data set. A review of maximum likelihood techniques 2.6: Mixture models 63 \\nin this context has been given by Redner and Walker (1984). \\nFor the case of Gaussian components of the form (2.77), the mixture den\\xad\\nsity contains the following adjustable parameters: P(j), /!,• and <jj (where j = \\n1,..., M). The negative log-likelihood for the data set is given by \\nE = -ln£ = - X>P(*n) = -J> I £>(xn|j)P(i) \\\\ (2.78) \\nn=l n=l |^ = 1 J \\nwhich can be regarded as an error function. Maximizing the likelihood £ is then \\nequivalent to minimizing E. \\nIt is important to emphasize that minimizing this error function is non-trivial \\nin a number of respects. First of all, there exist parameter values for which the \\nlikelihood goes to infinity (Day, 1969). These arise when one of the Gaussian \\ncomponents collapses onto one of the data points, as can be seen by setting', 'fij — x in (2.77) and then letting Oj —> 0. In addition, small groups of points \\nwhich are close together can give rise to local minima in the error function which \\nmay give poor representations of the true distribution. In practical problems we \\nwish to avoid the singular solutions and the inappropriate local minima. Several \\ntechniques for dealing with the problems of singularities have been proposed. One \\napproach is to constrain the components to have equal covariance matrices (Day, \\n1969). Alternatively, when one of the variance parameters shrinks to a small value \\nduring the course of an iterative algorithm, the corresponding Gaussian can be \\nreplaced with one having a larger width. \\nSince the error function is a smooth differentiable function of the parameters \\nof the mixture model, we can employ standard non-linear optimization tech\\xad\\nniques, such as those described in Chapter 7, to find its minima. We shall see in', 'Chapter 7, that there are considerable computational advantages in making use \\nof gradient information provided it can be evaluated efficiently. In the present \\ncase the derivatives of E can be found analytically. \\nFor the centres \\\\i: of the Gaussian components we find, by simple differenti\\xad\\nation of (2.78), and making use of (2.75) and (2.77), \\nf^£p(i|x»)^^. (2.79) c^i n=i ai \\nSimilarly, for the width parameter cr, we obtain \\nThe minimization of E with respect to the mixing parameters P(j) must be \\ncarried out subject to the constraints (2.72) and (2.73). This can be done by 64 2: Probability Density Estimation \\nrepresenting the mixing parameters in terms of a set of M auxiliary variables \\n{~(j} such that \\nexpfe) \\nEfcliexp(7fc) PU) = ^VKW, ,- (\"I) \\nThe transformation given by (2.81) is called the softmax function, or normalized \\nexponential, and ensures that, for —oo < 7j < oo, the constraints (2.72) and', '(2.73) are satisfied as required for probabilities. We can now perform an uncon\\xad\\nstrained minimization of the error function with respect to the {7,}. To find the \\nderivatives of E with respect to fj we make use of \\n^1 = 6jkP(j) - P(j)P(k) (2.82) \\nwhich follows from (2.81). Using the chain rule in the form \\nBE _^ dE dP(k) \\ndl. -Ajep(fc) a7j (28S) \\ntogether with (2.75) and (2.78), we then obtain the required derivatives in the \\nform \\nBP N \\nwhere we have made use of (2.76). The complete set of derivatives of the error \\nfunction with respect to the parameters of the model, given by (2.79), (2.80) \\nand (2.84), can then be used in the non-linear optimization algorithms described \\nin Chapter 7 to provide practical techniques for finding minima of the error \\nfunction. \\nSome insight into the nature of the maximum likelihood solution can be \\nobtained by considering the expressions for the parameters at a minimum of E. \\nSetting (2.79) to zero we obtain \\na EnPQW ,285* \\nMj~ EnPUW ( 85)', 'which represents the intuitively satisfying result that the mean of the jth compo\\xad\\nnent is just the mean of the data vectors, weighted by the posterior probabilities \\nthat the corresponding data points were generated from that component.

Finally, setting the derivative in \\n(2.84) to zero we obtain \\n1 N \\npM = Ar£p0\\'1xn) (2-87) \\nso that, at the maximum likelihood solution, the prior probability for the jth \\ncomponent is given by the posterior probabilities for that component, averaged \\nover the data set. \\n2.6.2 The EM algorithm \\nWhile the formulae given in (2.85), (2.86) and (2.87) provide useful insight into', \"the nature of the maximum likelihood solution, they do not provide a direct \\nmethod for calculating the parameters. In fact they represent highly non-linear \\ncoupled equations, since the parameters occur implicitly on the right-hand sides \\nby virtue of (2.75). They do, however, suggest that we might seek an iterative \\nscheme for finding the minima of E. Suppose we begin by making some initial \\nguess for the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model, which we shall call \\nthe 'old' parameter values. We can then evaluate the right-hand sides in (2.85), \\n(2.86) and (2.87), and this will give a revised estimate for the parameters, which \\nwe shall call the 'new' parameter values, for which we might hope the value of the \\nerror function is smaller. These parameter values then become the 'old' values, \\nand the process is repeated. We shall show that, provided some care is taken \\nover the way in which the updates are performed, an algorithm of this form can\", 'be found which is guaranteed to decrease the error function at each iteration, \\nuntil a local minimum is found. This provides a simple, practical method for \\nestimating the mixture parameters which avoids the complexities of non-linear \\noptimization algorithms. We shall also see that this is a special case of a more \\ngeneral procedure known as the expectation-maximization, or EM, algorithm \\n(Dempster et al., 1977). \\nFrom (2.78) we can write the change in error when we replace the old pa\\xad\\nrameter values by the new values in the form \\n£new_£o,d = _pnj^^j (2.g8) \\nwhere pnew(x) denotes the probability density evaluated using the new values \\nfor the parameters, while pold(x) represents the density evaluated using the old \\nparameter values.

A very general treatment of such \\nincomplete-data problems was given by Dempster et al. (1977), who developed \\nthe EM algorithm as an elegant and powerful approach to their solution. It can \\nalso be applied to problems in which incompleteness of the data takes the form \\nof missing values for some of the variables in the training set. The example of \\nre-estimating the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model discussed above is a \\nspecial case of the EM algorithm. \\nWe have already remarked that the problem of determining the parameters\", 'in the mixture model would be very straightforward if we knew which compo\\xad\\nnent j was responsible for generating each data point. We therefore consider \\na hypothetical complete data set in which each data point is labelled with the \\ncomponent which generated it. Thus, for each data point x\", we can introduce a \\nvariable zn, which is an integer in the range (1,M) specifying which component \\nof the mixture generated the data point.

This sum is then easily \\nminimized with respect to the parameters of the component distributions. The \\nproblem, however, is that we do not know which component is responsible for \\neach data point, and hence we do not know the distribution of the zn. We there\\xad\\nfore adopt the following procedure. First we guess some values for the parameters \\nof the mixture model (the 'old' parameter values) and we then use these, together \\nwith Bayes' theorem, to find the probability distribution of the {zn}.

After some simple \\nalgebra we obtain \\nMW+1 = ^N + ^N+1(XN+1 _ ^Nj (2108) \\n1 \\nwhere the parameter rff^1 is given by \\nAs it stands this does not constitute a useful algorithm since the denominator \\nin (2.109) contains an ever increasing number of terms, all of which would have to \\nbe re-estimated every time the parameter values were changed. It would therefore \\nrequire the storage of all previous data points, in conflict with the goal of a \\nstochastic learning procedure. One approach is to note that, if the model had Exercises 73 \\nalready converged to the maximum likelihood solution, we could use (2.87) to \\nwrite (2.109) in the form \\n^ (N + l)P(j) (2-UU) \\nand then to use this as an approximation for the T]J .

We also showed how the posterior prob\\xad\\nabilities can be related to class-conditional densities through Bayes' theorem, and \\nin Chapter 2 we described several techniques for estimating these densities. An \\nalternative approach, which circumvents the determination of probability densi\\xad\\nties, is based on the idea of a discriminant function, also introduced in Chapter 1. \\nIn a practical application of discriminant functions, specific parametrized func\\xad\\ntional forms are chosen, and the values of the parameters are then determined\", 'from a set of training data by means of a suitable learning algorithm. \\nThe simplest choice of discriminant function consists of a linear combination \\nof the input variables, in which the coefficients in the linear combination are the \\nparameters of the model, and has been considered widely in the literature on \\nconventional approaches to pattern recognition. This simple discriminant can be \\ngeneralized by transforming the linear combination with a non-linear function \\n(called an activation function) which leads to concepts such as logistic regression \\nand the perceptron. Another extension involves transforming the input variables \\nwith fixed non-linear functions before forming the linear combination, to give \\ngeneralized linear discriminants. As we shall see, these various forms of linear \\ndiscriminant can be regarded as forms of neural network in which there is a single \\nlayer of adaptive weights between the inputs and the outputs.', \"Various techniques exist for determining the weight values in single-layer \\nnetworks, and in this chapter we shall consider several of them in detail. In \\nparticular, we shall study perceptron learning, least-squares methods and the \\nFisher discriminant. As well as forming an important class of techniques in their \\nown right, single-layer networks provide many useful insights into the properties \\nof more complex multi-layer networks. Single-layer networks were widely studied \\nin the 1960's, and the history of such networks is reviewed in Widrow and Lehr \\n(1990). Two useful books from this period are Nilsson (1965) and Lewis and \\nCoates (1967). \\n3.1 Linear discriminant functions \\nIn Chapter 1 we saw that optimal discriminant functions can be determined \\nfrom class-conditional densities via Bayes' theorem. Instead of performing density \\nestimation, however, we can postulate specific parametrized functional forms for 78 3: Single-Layer Networks\", 'the discriminant functions and use the training data set to determine suitable \\nvalues for the parameters. In this section we consider various forms of linear \\ndiscriminant, and discuss their properties. \\n3.1.1 Two classes \\nWe begin by considering the two-category classification problem. In Chapter 1 \\nwe introduced the concept of a discriminant function y(x) such that the vector \\nx is assigned to class C\\\\ if t/(x) > 0 and to class C2 if y(x) < 0. The simplest \\nchoice of discriminant function is one which is linear in the components of x, \\nand which can therefore be written as \\ny(x) = wTx + w0 (3.1) \\nwhere we shall refer to the rf-dimensional vector w as the weight vector and the \\nparameter wo as the bias. Sometimes —wo is called a threshold. Note that the use \\nof the term bias here is quite distinct from the concept of statistical bias which \\nis discussed briefly on page 41, and at length in Section 9.1. Prom Section 2.1.3', 'we know that, for class-conditional densities having normal distributions with \\nequal covariance matrices, a linear discriminant of the form (3.1) is optimal. \\nThe expression in (3.1) has a simple geometrical interpretation (Duda and \\nHart, 1973) as follows. We first note that the decision boundary y(x) = 0 cor\\xad\\nresponds to a (rf — l)-dimensional hyperplane in rf-dimensional x-space. For the \\ncase of a two-dimensional input space, rf = 2, the decision boundary is a straight \\nline, as shown in Figure 3.1. If xA and xB are two points on the hyperplane, then \\ny(xA) — 0 = 2/(xB) and so, using (3.1), we have wT(xs — xA) — 0. Thus, w is \\nnormal to any vector lying in the hyperplane, and so we see that w determines \\nthe orientation of the decision boundary. If x is a point on the hyperplane then \\nthe normal distance from the origin to the hyperplane is given by \\n/=|RT = \"M (3\\'2) \\nwhere we have used y(x) — 0 together with (3.1). Thus, the bias WQ determines', 'the position of the hyperplane in x-space, as indicated in Figure 3.1. \\nThere is a slightly different notation which we can adopt which will often \\nprove convenient. If we define new (d + l)-dimensional vectors w = (iuo,w) and \\nx = (l,x), then we can rewrite (3.1) in the form \\ny(x) = wTx. (3.3) \\nWith this notation we can interpret the decision boundary y{x) = 0 as a rf-\\ndimensional hyperplane which passes through the origin in (d + l)-dimensional \\nx-space. \\nWe can represent the linear discriminant function in (3.1) or (3.3) in terms 3.1: Linear discriminant functions 79 \\nX2 I \\ns. *v ^ \\n/ / \\nXw \\nN \\n\\\\ S yw = o \\n™ ^^» ^ \\n/ -Wo ^ \\n^s llwil \\nFigure 3.1.

(3.4) \\nA new point x is then assigned to class Ck if 2/k(x) > «/j(x) for all j ^ k. The \\ndecision boundary separating class Ck from class Cj is given by yk(x.) = yj(x)', 'which, for linear discriminants, corresponds to a hyperplane of the form \\n(wfc - Wj)Tx + (wjto - Wjo) = 0. (3.5) \\nBy analogy with our earlier results for the single discriminant (3.1), we see that \\nthe normal to the decision boundary is given by the difference between the two \\nweight vectors, and that the perpendicular distance of the decision boundary \\nfrom the origin is given by \\nl = J^-W»l (3.6) \\nThe multiclass linear discriminant function (3.4) can be expressed in terms of \\na neural network diagram as shown in Figure 3.3. The circles at the top of \\nthe diagram, corresponding to the functions yfc(x) in (3.4) are sometimes called \\nprocessing units, and the evaluation of the discriminant functions can be viewed \\nas a flow of information from the inputs to the outputs. Each output yk{x) is \\nassociated with a weight vector wfc and a bias wkQ. We can express the network \\noutputs in terms of the components of the vectors {w^} to give \\nyk(x) = Y2wkiXi+v}k0.

Any point x which lies on the line joining xA and x£ \\nas can be written \\nx = axA + (1 - a)xf (3.9) \\nwhere 0 < a < 1.

Thus, \\nall points on the line connecting xA and xB also lie in 1Zk and so the region Tlk \\nmust be simply connected and convex. 82 3: Single-Layer Networks \\n3.1.3 Logistic discrimination \\nSo far we have considered discriminant functions which are simple linear func\\xad\\ntions of the input variables. There are several ways in which such functions can\", \"be generalized, and here we consider the use of a non-linear function g(-) which \\nacts on the linear sum to give a discriminant function for the two-class problem \\nof the form \\ny = p(wTx + w0) (3.10) \\nwhere g() is called an activation function and is generally chosen to be mono-\\ntonic. The form (3.10) is still regarded as a linear discriminant since the decision \\nboundary which it generates is still linear, as a consequence of the monotonic \\nnature of g(-). \\nAs a motivation for this form of discriminant, consider a two-class problem \\nin which the class-conditional densities are given by Gaussian distributions with \\nequal covariance matrices Ei = £2 = S, so that \\np(x|Cfe) = (2^)^|S|V2 exp {~1(X ~ ^)TS_1(X ~ ***>} • (3-H> \\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of membership of class C\\\\ is \\ngiven by \\nP(d|x) p(x|Ci)P(d) \\np(x|C1)P(C1)+p(x|C2)P(C2) \\n1 \\n1 + exp(—0) \\n= 0(a) \\na^n^\\\\P3\\\\ (3.12) \\n(3.13) \\n(3.14) \\n(3.15) where \\n%(x|C2)P(C2)\", \"and the function g(a) is the logistic sigmoid activation function given by \\ng{a) ~ —. r (3.16) \\nyv ' 1 + exp(-a) v ' \\nwhich is plotted in Figure 3.5.

This \\nimplies that such a discriminant is providing more than simply a classification \\ndecision, and is potentially a very powerful result. The importance of interpreting \\nthe outputs of networks in terms of probabilities is discussed at much greater \\nlength in Chapter 6.\", \"The term sigmoid means 'S-shaped', and the logistic form of the sigmoid maps \\nthe interval (—oo, oo) onto (0,1). If |o| is small, then the logistic sigmoid function \\ng(a) can be approximated by a linear function, and so in this sense a network \\nwith sigmoidal activation functions contains a linear network as a special case. \\nIf there are more than two classes then an extension of the previous analysis \\nleads to a generalization of the logistic sigmoid called a normalized exponential \\nor softmax, which is discussed in detail in Section 6.9. \\nLinear discriminants with logistic activation functions have been widely used \\nin the statistics literature under the name logistic discrimination (Anderson, \\n1982). Sigmoidal activation functions also play a crucial role in multi-layer neural \\nnetworks, as discussed in Chapter 4. \\nAnother form of linear discriminant was introduced by McCulloch and Pitts\", \"(1943) as a simple mathematical model for the behaviour of a single neuron in 84 3: Single-Layer Networks \\na biological nervous system. Again this takes the form (3.10) with an activation \\nfunction which is the Heaviside step function \\n, > / 0 when a < 0 ,„ on. \\nff(a) = {l whena>0.

Although this model has its origins \\nin biology, it is clear that it can equally well be motivated within the framework \\nof statistical pattern recognition. Networks of threshold units were studied by \\nRosenblatt (1962) under the name perceptrons and by Widrow and Hoff (1960) \\nwho called them adalines. They will be discussed in detail in Section 3.5.\", 'Note that it is sometimes convenient to regard the linear discriminant (3.1) \\nas a special case of the more general form (3.10). In this case the model is said \\nto have a linear activation function, which in fact is just the identity g(a) = a. \\n3.1.4 Binary input vectors \\nLinear discriminants, and the logistic activation function, also arise in a natural \\nway when we consider input patterns in which the variables are binary (so that \\neach Xi can take only the values 0 or 1). Let Pki denote the probability that \\nthe input Xj takes the value +1 when the input vector is drawn from the class \\nCk. The corresponding probability that Xi = 0 is then given by 1 — Pki. We can \\ncombine these together to write the probability for Xi to take either of its allowed \\nvalues in the form \\np(xi\\\\Ck) = P£(l-Pki)1-x< (3.21) \\nwhich is calleda Bernoulli distribution. If we now assume that the input variables \\nare statistically independent, we obtain the probability for the complete input', 'vector as the product of the probabilities for each of the components separately: \\np(x\\\\Ck) = f[Pk*i(l-Pki)1-*i. (3.22) \\nWe now recall from Chapter 1 that we can write a discriminant function which \\nminimizes the probability of misclassifying new inputs in the form \\nyk(x) = In P{x\\\\Ck) + In P(Ck). (3.23) \\nSubstituting (3.22) into (3.23) we obtain a linear discriminant function given by 3.2: Linear separability 85 \\n2/k(x) = X] WkiXi + Wk0 (3-24) «=l \\nin which the weights and bias are given by \\nwki = lnPki-ln(l-Pki) (3.25) \\nd \\nwfc0 = J2la^ ~ Pfci) + ln P(Ck^ (3-26) »=1 \\nWe have already seen that, for two classes with normally distributed class-\\nconditional densities, the posterior probabilities can be obtained from the linear \\ndiscriminant by applying a logistic activation function. A similar result holds \\nalso for the Bernoulli distribution. Consider a set of independent binary variables \\nXj, having Bernoulli class-conditional densities given by (3.22), If we substitute', \"(3.22) into (3.12) we again obtain a single-layer network structure, with a logistic \\nactivation function, of the form \\nP(Ci |x) = 5(wTx + w0) (3.27) \\nwhere g(a) is given by (3.16) and \\nWe have shown that, both for normally distributed and Bernoulli distributed \\nclass-conditional densities, the posterior probabilities are obtained by a logistic \\nsingle-layer network. In fact these are particular instances of a much more general \\nresult, which is derived in Section 6.7.1. \\n3.2 Linear separability \\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed discriminant functions having a decision \\nboundary which is linear, or more generally hyperplanar in higher dimensions. \\nClearly this is a very restricted class of decision boundary, and we might well \\nexpect such systems to have less than optimal performance for many practical \\napplications. Indeed, this provides' the principal motivation for using multi-layer \\nnetworks of the kind discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. The particular nature of\", 'the limitation inherent in single-layer systems warrants some careful discussion, \\nhowever. 86 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nMc, c, \\nO O \\nc, c, \\nFigure 3.6. The exclusive-OR problem consists of four patterns in a two-\\ndimensional space as shown. It provides a simple example of a problem which \\nis not linearly separable. \\nConsider for the moment the problem of learning to classify a given data set \\nexactly, where each input vector has been labelled as belonging to one of two \\nclasses C\\\\ and C%. If all of the points can be a classified correctly by a linear \\n(i.e. hyperplanar) decision boundary, then the points are said to be linearly \\nseparable. For such a data set there exist weight and bias values such that a \\nlinear discriminant will lead to perfect classification. A simple example of a data \\nset which is not linearly separable is provided by the two-dimensional exclusive-\\nOR problem, also known as XOR, illustrated in Figure 3.6. The input vectors', \"x = (0,0) and (1,1) belong to class C\\\\, while the input vectors (0,1) and (1,0) \\nbelong to class C%. It is clear that there is no linear decision boundary which can \\nclassify all four points correctly. This problem can be generalized to d-dimensions \\nwhen it is known as the rf-bit parity problem. In this case the data set consists \\nof all possible binary input vectors of length d, which are classified as class C\\\\ if \\nthere is an even number of l's in the input vector, and as class Ci otherwise. \\nFor the case of continuous input variables it is interesting to consider the \\nprobability that a random set of patterns will be linearly separable. Suppose \\nwe have N data points distributed at random in d dimensions. Note that the \\nparticular distribution used to generate the random points is not relevant. All \\nthat we require is that there are no accidental degeneracies, i.e. that there is no \\nsubset of d or fewer points which are linearly dependent. The points are then\", 'said to be in general position. Having chosen the points, imagine that we then \\nrandomly assign each of the points to one of the two classes C\\\\ and Ci with equal \\nprobability. Each possible assignment for the complete data set is referred to as \\na dichotomy, and for N points there are 2N possible dichotomies. We now ask \\nwhat fraction F(N, d) of these dichotomies is linearly separable. It can be shown \\n(Cover, 1965) that this fraction is given by the expression 3.2: Linear separability 87 \\n3 4 \\nN/(d+\\\\) \\nFigure 3.7. Plot of the fraction F(N,d) of the dichotomies of N data points \\nin d dimensions which are linearly separable, as a function of N/(d + 1), for \\nvarious values of d. \\n1 \\nF{N, d) = \\n2N 1 d \\nt=0 JV-1 \\ni when JV < d 4-1 \\nwhen JV > d + 1 (3.30) \\nwhich is plotted as a function of N/(d + 1) in Figure 3.7 for d = 1, d = 20 and \\n<i = oo. Here the symbol \\nJV! \\n(N ~M)\\\\M\\\\ (3.31) \\ndenotes the number of combinations of M objects selected from a total of JV. We', 'see from (3.30) that, if the number of data points is fewer than d+1, any labelling \\nof the points will always lead to a linearly separable problem. For JV = 2(d+ 1), \\nthe probability of linear separability is 0.5 for any value of d (Exercise 3.5). In \\na practical application, the positions of points from the same class will tend to \\nbe correlated, and so the probability that a data set with a much larger number \\nof points than 2(d + 1) will be linearly separable is higher than (3.30) would \\nsuggest. \\nFor the case of binary input patterns, if there are d inputs then there are \\n2d possible input patterns and hence 22 possible labellings of those patterns \\nbetween two classes. Those which can be implemented by a perceptron are called \\nthreshold logic functions and form an extremely small subset (less than 2d /d!) \\nof the total (Lewis and Coates, 1967). \\nIn the neural computing literature a lot of attention is often paid to the in\\xad', 'ability of single-layer networks to solve simple problems such as XOR. From our \\nstatistical pattern recognition perspective, however, we see that the ability of \\na particular model to provide an exact representation of a given training set is 88 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nlargely irrelevant. We are primarily interested in designing systems with good \\ngeneralization performance, so that they give the greatest accuracy when pre\\xad\\nsented with previously unseen data. Furthermore, problems such as XOR and \\nparity involve learning the complete set of all possible input patterns, so the \\nconcept of generalization does not even apply. Finally, they have the property \\nthat the smallest possible change in the input pattern produces the largest pos\\xad\\nsible change in the output. Most practical pattern recognition problems have the \\nopposite characteristic, so that small changes in the inputs do not, for the most \\npart, produce large changes in the outputs, and hence the mapping represented', 'by the network should be relatively smooth. > \\nConsider the problem of two normally-distributed classes with equal covari-\\nance matrices, discussed in Section 2.1.3. Since the class distributions overlap it \\nis entirely possible that a finite sized data set drawn from these distributions will \\nnot be linearly separable. However, we know that the optimal decision boundary \\nis in fact linear. A single-layer network can therefore achieve the best possible \\nclassification performance on unseen data, even though it may not separate the \\ntraining data exactly. \\nThe key consideration concerns the choice of an appropriate discriminant \\nfunction for the particular problem in hand. This may involve a combination \\nof prior knowledge of the general form which the solution should take, coupled \\nwith an empirical comparison of the performance of alternative models. These \\nissues are considered in more detail in Chapters 8, 9 and 10. Here we simply', 'note that single-layer networks correspond to a very narrow class of possible \\ndiscriminant functions, and in many practical situations may not; represent the \\noptimal choice. Nevertheless, single-layer networks remain of considerable prac\\xad\\ntical importance in providing a benchmark against which the performance of \\nmore complex multi-layer networks can be assessed. The fact that single-layer \\nnetworks can often be trained very quickly, as shown in Section 3.4, gives them a \\nparticular advantage over more complex network structures which often require \\nconsiderable computational effort to train. \\n3.3 Generalized linear discriminants \\nOne way to generalize the discriminant functions, so as to permit a much larger \\nrange of possible decision boundaries, is to transform the input vector x using a \\nset of M predefined non-linear functions </>j(x), sometimes called basis functions, \\nand then to represent the output as a linear combination of these functions \\nM', \"Vk(x) = ^twfcj^-(x) + wk0. (3.32) \\nj=i \\nThis now represents a much larger class of functions yk(x). In fact, as discussed in \\nChapters 4 and 5, for a suitable choice of the basis functions <^j(x), the function \\nin (3.32) can approximate any continuous functional transformation to arbitrary 3.^: Least-squares techniques 89 \\naccuracy. Again, we can absorb the biases as special cases of the weights by \\ndefining an extra basis function <f>o = 1, so that \\nM \\nyk(x) = J2w*i't'i(x)- (3-33) 3=0 \\nWe have assumed that the basis functions <f>j(x) are fixed, independently of the \\ndata. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss multi-layer neural networks, many of which can \\nbe regarded as generalized discriminant functions of the form (3.32), but in which \\nthe basis functions themselves can be modified during the training process. \\n3.4 Least-squares techniques \\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed various forms of single-layer network\", 'and explored some of their properties. The remainder of the chapter is concerned \\nwith techniques for training such networks, and we begin with a discussion of \\nmethods based on the minimization of a sum-of-squares error function. This is \\nthe simplest form of error function and is most suitable for regression problems. \\nWhile it can also be used for classification problems, there exist other, more \\nappropriate, error functions, discussed at length in Chapter 6. \\n3.4.1 Sum-of-squares error function \\nFor consistency with the discussions in Chapter 5, we shall consider the error \\nminimization problem in the context of the generalized linear network (3.33). \\nThis contains the simple linear discriminant of (3.4) as a special case in which \\nthe <f>j(x) simply correspond to the input variables Xj. The sum-of-squares error \\nfunction is given by a sum over all patterns in the training set, and over all \\noutputs, of the form \\n£(w) = \\\\ £ X>*(x\";w) - ^>2 <3-34)', 'where j/fc(xn; w) represents the output of unit k as a function of the input vector \\nxn and the weight vector w, N is the number of training patterns, and c is the \\nnumber of outputs. The quantity tjj represents the target value for output unit k \\nwhen the input vector is x\". This error function is a smooth function of the weight \\nparameters u>kj, and can be minimized by a variety of standard techniques. Since \\n(3.33) is a linear function of the weights, the error function E(w) is a quadratic \\nfunction of the weights, and hence its derivatives with respect to the weights \\nare linear functions of the weights.. The solution for the weight values at the \\nminimum of the error function can therefore be found exactly in closed form, as \\nwe shall see in Section 3.4.3. 90 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nFigure 3.8. Geometrical interpretation of the solution to the least-squares prob\\xad\\nlem, illustrated for the case of 3 training patterns (JV = 3) and 2 basis functions', '4>o and (pi (corresponding to M — 1). The target values tn are grouped together \\nto form an iV-dimensional vector t which lives in an ./V-dimensional Euclidean \\nspace. The corresponding network outputs can similarly be represented as a \\nvector y which consists of a linear combination of M 4- 1 basis vectors tf>j, \\nwhich themselves span an (M + l)-dimensional Euclidean sub-space S. The \\nleast-squares solution for y is given by the orthogonal projection of t onto S. \\n3.4.2 Geometrical interpretation of least squares \\nBefore deriving a solution for the weights, it is instructive to consider a geo\\xad\\nmetrical interpretation of the least-squares problem. To do this we consider a \\nnetwork having a single output y. There is no loss of generality in doing this \\nas the same discussion applies separately to each output of the network. For a \\nparticular input pattern x™ we can write the network output as \\nM \\nwhere tfft = cf>j(xn). We now group the target values together to form an N-', 'dimensional vector t whose elements are given by tn. This vector can be con\\xad\\nsidered to live in an iV-dimensional Euclidean space, as indicated in Figure 3.8. \\nFor each basis function <?^(x) we can similarly group the N values of <$\", corre\\xad\\nsponding to the N data points, to make a vector 4>j, also of dimension N, which \\ncan be drawn in the same space as the vector t. For the moment we shall assume \\nthat the number of basis functions (including the bias) is less than the number \\nof patterns, so that M + 1 < N. The M + 1 vectors <f>j, corresponding to the \\nM + 1 basis functions, then form a (non-orthogonal) basis set which spans an \\n(M + l)-dimensional Euclidean sub-space S. The network outputs yn can also \\nbe grouped to form a vector y. From (3.35) we see that y is given by a linear \\ncombination of the 4>j of the form 3-4: Least-squares techniques 91 \\nM \\nj=0 (3.36) \\nso that y is constrained to lie in the sub-space S, as shown in Figure 3.8. By', 'changing the values of the weights Wj we can change the location of y subject to \\nthis constraint. \\nThe sum-of-squares error (3.34) can now be written in the form \\nH M \\nj=0 (3.37) \\nIf we minimize this expression with respect to the weights Wj we find \\n||=0 = ^r(y-f), j = l,...,M. (3.38) \\nThis represents a set of coupled equations for the weights, known as the normal \\nequations of the least-squares problem, for which we shall find an explicit solution \\nshortly. Before doing so, however, it is useful to consider the geometrical inter\\xad\\npretation of (3.38). Let us decompose t into the sum of two vectors t = tj_ + i|| \\nwhere t|| is the orthogonal projection of t onto the sub-space S, and tj_ is the \\nremainder. Then <j>7t± = 0 by definition, and hence from (3.38) we have \\n?7(?-*D = o, j = l,...,M. (3.39) \\nSince the vectors 4>i form a basis set which span the sub-space S, we can solve \\n(3.39) to give \\ny = h (3.40)', 'and so the solution vector is just the projection of the vector of target values \\nonto the sub-space spanned by the basis vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.8. This \\nresult is intuitively correct, since the process of learning corresponds to choosing \\na direction for y such as to minimize its distance from t. Since y is constrained \\nto lie in the sub-space, the best we can do is choose it to correspond to the \\northogonal projection of t onto S. This minimizes the length of the error vector \\ne = y — t. Note that the residual error vector (fmin = i|| — t — —t± is then \\northogonal to S, so that (f>Jemm — 0- 92 3: Single-Layer Networks \\n3.4.3 Pseudo-inverse solution \\nWe now proceed to find an exact solution to the least-squares problem. To do \\nthis we return to the case of a network having c outputs. Using the expression \\n(3.33), we can write the sum-of-squares error function (3.34) in the form \\nN c ( M \\\\2 \\nn=lfc=l (^=0 J', \"Differentiating this expression with respect to w^j and setting the derivative to \\nzero gives the normal equations for the least-squares problem in the form \\n£{£™fc;<^-t2U?=0.

The matrix # «& \\nin (3.43) is a square matrix of dimension M x M. Provided it is non-singular we \\nmay invert it to obtain a solution to (3.43) which can be written in the form \\nWT = $tT (3.44) \\nwhere 3?' is an M x N matrix known as the pseudo-inverse of 4? (Golub and \\nKalian, 1965; Rao and Mitra, 1971) and is given by \\n*t = ($T$)-1$T (3.45) \\nSince <& is, in general, a non-square matrix it does not itself have a true inverse, \\nbut the pseudo-inverse does have the property (as is easily seen from 3.45) that\", \"#T<j> = J where I is the unit matrix. Note, however, that *4?' ^ I in general. If \\nthe matrix $T$ is singular then (3.43) does not have a unique solution. However, \\nif the pseudo-inverse is defined by \\n*t = nm (*T* + eI)-1*T (3.46) 3.4: Least-squares techniques 93 \\nthen it can be shown that the limit always exists, and that this limiting value \\nminimizes E (Rao and Mitra, 1971). \\nIn practice, the direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical \\ndifficulties due to the possibility of $ $ being singular or nearly singular. This \\ncan arise if two of the basis vectors <j>j, shown in Figure 3.8, are nearly collinear. \\nThe effects of noise and numerical error can then lead to very large values for \\nthe weights which give near cancellation between these vectors. Figure 3.9(a) \\nshows two basis vectors 4n and <j>2 which are nearly orthogonal, together with \\nthe component i/j| of y which lies in the plane spanned by fa and $2- The corre\\xad\", 'sponding weight values needed to express y^ as a linear combination of fa and \\n<f>2 have relatively small values. By contrast, Figure 3.9(b) shows the correspond\\xad\\ning situation when the vectors fa and fa are nearly collinear. In this case the \\nweights need to adopt large (positive or negative) values in order to represent \\nj/|| as a linear combination of the basis vectors. In the case where the two basis \\nvectors are exactly collinear, we can write fa = Xfa for some constant A. Then \\nu>i(/>i + W2&2 = (wi + ^2) fa and onby the combination (v>i + AW2) is fixed \\nby the least-squares procedure, with the value of u>2, say, being arbitrary. Near \\ndegeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real, noisy data sets. In \\npractice, such problems are best resolved by using the technique of singular value \\ndecomposition (SVD) to find a solution for the weights. A good introduction to \\nSVD, together with a suggested numerical implementation, can be found in Press', \"et al. (1992). Such an approach avoids problems due to the accumulation of nu\\xad\\nmerical roundoff errors, and automatically selects (from amongst a set of nearly \\ndegenerate solutions) the one for which the length || wfc|| of the fcth weight vector \\nis shortest. \\nIn the above discussion, the bias parameters were treated as a special case \\nof the weights. We can gain some insight into the role of the biases if we make \\nthem explicit. If we consider the minimization of (3.41) with respect to the bias \\nparameters alone we obtain \\nd^T0 = E | Y>H+1 + «*o - $ | = 0 (3.47) \\nwhich can be solved for the biases to give \\nM \\n•Wko = *fc - E Wk^i (3'48) \\nwhere 94 3: Single-Layer Networks \\n(b) \\nFigure 3.9. In (a) we see two basis vectors (j>i and 4>i which are nearly orthog\\xad\\nonal. The least-squares solution vector y^ is given by a linear combination of \\nthese vectors, with relatively small values for the coefficients w\\\\ and wi. In (b)\", 'the basis vectors are nearly collinear, and the magnitudes of the corresponding \\nweight values become very large. \\nThis result tells us that the role of the bias parameters is to compensate for the \\ndifference between the mean (over the training set) of the output vector for the \\nnetwork and the corresponding mean of the target data. \\nIf #T is a square non-singular matrix, the pseudo-inverse reduces to the usual \\ninverse. The matrix is square when N = M, so that the number of patterns equals \\nthe number of basis functions. If we multiply (3.43) by ($T)_1 we obtain \\n$WT = T. (3.50) \\nIf we write this in index notation we have \\nM \\nX>JW# = tf (3.51) \\n3=0 \\nand we see that, for each input pattern, the network outputs are exactly equal to \\nthe corresponding target values, and hence the sum-of-squares error (3.41) will \\nbe zero. The condition for ($ )\"\"\"\\' to exist is that the columns 4>n of the matrix \\n<&T be linearly independent. If the vectors </>\" are not linearly independent, so', \"that the effective value of N is less than M, then the least-squares problem 3-4: Least-squares techniques 95 \\nis under-determined. Similarly, if there are fewer patterns than basis functions, \\nso that N < M, then the least-squares problem is again under-determined. In \\nsuch cases, there is a continuum of solutions for the weights, all of which give \\nzero error. Singular value decomposition leads to a numerically well-behaved \\nalgorithm which picks out the particular solution for which the magnitude ||w/t|| \\nof the weight vector for each output unit k is the shortest. As we have already \\nindicated in Chapter 1, it is desirable to have a sufficiently large training set \\nthat the weight values are 'over-determined', so that in practice we arrange that \\nN > M, which corresponds to the situation depicted in Figure 3.8. \\n3.4.4 Gradient descent \\nWe have shown how, for a linear network, the weight values which minimize the\", 'sum-of-squares error function can be found explicitly in terms of the pseudo-\\ninverse of a matrix. It is important to note that this result is only possible for \\nthe case of a linear network, with a sum-of-squares error function. If a non-linear \\nactivation function, such as a sigmoid, is used, or if a different error function \\nis considered, then a closed form solution is no longer possible. However, if the \\nactivation function is differentiable, as is the case for the logistic sigmoid in (3.16) \\nfor instance, the derivatives of the error function with respect to the weight \\nparameters can easily be evaluated. These derivatives can then be used in a \\nvariety of gradient-based optimization algorithms, discussed in Chapter 7, for \\nfinding the minimum of the error function. Here we consider one of the simplest \\nof such algorithms, known as gradient descent. \\nIt is convenient to group all of the parameters (weights and biases) in the', 'network together to form a single weight vector w, so that the error function \\ncan be expressed as E = JB(W). Provided E is a differentiable function of w we \\nmay adopt the following procedure. We begin with an initial guess for w (which \\nmight for instance be chosen at random) and we then update the weight vector \\nby moving a small distance in w-space in the direction in which E decreases most \\nrapidly, i.e. in the direction of —Vw-E. By iterating this process we generate a \\nsequence of weight vectors w(T) whose components are calculated using \\n(T+1) (r) 9E \\nwhere rj is a small positive number called the learning rate parameter. Under \\nsuitable conditions the sequence of weight vectors will converge to a point at \\nwhich E is minimized. The choice of the value for r) can be fairly critical, since \\nif it is too small the reduction in error will be very slow, while, if it is too large, \\ndivergent oscillations can result.', \"In general the error function is given by a sum of terms each of which is \\ncalculated using just one of the patterns from the training set, so that \\n£(w) = ]T)£n(w) (3.53) \\nn (3.52) 96 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nwhere the term En is calculated using pattern n only. In this case we can update \\nthe weight vector using just one pattern at a time \\n(T+I) (T) 9En \\nand this is repeated many times by cycling through all of the patterns used in the \\n.definition of E.

The perceptron network used a fixed set of processing elements, \\ndenoted <f>j, followed by a layer of adaptive weights Wj and a threshold acti\\xad\", 'vation function g(-). The processing elements <pj typically also had threshold \\nactivation functions, and took inputs from a randomly chosen subset of the \\npixels of the input image. \\n3.5 The perceptron \\nSingle-layer networks, with threshold activation functions, were studied by Rosen\\xad\\nblatt (1962) who called them perceptrons. Rosenblatt also built hardware imple\\xad\\nmentations of these networks, which incorporated learning using an algorithm \\nto be discussed below. These networks were applied to classification problems, \\nin which the inputs were usually binary images of characters or simple shapes. \\nThe properties of perceptrons are reviewed in Block (1962). \\nAt the same time as Rosenblatt was developing the perceptron, Widrow and \\nco-workers were working along similar lines using systems known as adalines \\n(Widrow and Lehr, 1990). The term adaline comes from ADAptive LINear Ele\\xad\\nment, and refers to a single processing unit with threshold non-linearity (Widrow', 'and HofT, 1960) of essentially the same form as the perceptron. \\nWe have already seen that a network with a single layer of weights has very \\nlimited capabilities. To improve the performance of the perceptron, Rosenblatt \\nused a layer of fixed processing elements to transform the raw input data, as \\nshown in Figure 3.10. These processing elements can be regarded as the basis \\nfunctions of a generalized linear discriminant. They typically took the form of \\nfixed weights connected to a random subset of the input pixels, with a threshold \\nactivation function of the form (3.20).

More generally we could introduce a loss matrix (Section 1.10) \\nand consider the total loss incurred as a result of a particular classification of \\nthe data set. Such error measures, however, prove very difficult to work with \\nin practice. This is because smooth changes in the values of the weights (and \\nbiases) cause the decision boundaries to move across the data points resulting \\nin discontinuous changes in the error. The error function is therefore piecewise\", 'constant, and so procedures akin to gradient descent cannot be applied. We \\ntherefore seek other error functions which can be more easily minimized. \\nIn this section we consider a continuous, piecewise-linear error function called \\nthe perceptron criterion. As each input vector xra is presented to the inputs of \\nthe network it generates a corresponding vector of activations <f>n in the first-\\nlayer processing elements. Suppose we associate with each input vector xn a \\ncorresponding target value tn, such that the desired output from the network \\nis tn = +1 if the input vector belongs to class C\\\\, and tn = — 1 if the vector \\nbelongs to class C^. Prom (3.65) and (3.66) we want wT(/>n > 0 for vectors from \\nclass C\\\\, and wT0n < 0 for vectors from class Ci- It therefore follows that for all \\nvectors we want to have •wr(<pntn) > 0. This suggests that we try to minimize \\nthe following error function, known as the perceptron criterion \\n£Perc(w) = _ £ WT(<t>ntn) (3.67)', 'where M is the set of vectors 4>n which are misclassified by the current weight \\nvector w. The error function jBperc(w) is the sum of a number of positive terms, \\nand equals zero if all of the data points are correctly classified. From the dis\\xad\\ncussion in Section 3.1 we see that JEperc(w) is proportional to the sum, over all \\nof the input patterns which are misclassified, of the (absolute) distances to the \\ndecision boundary. During training, the decision boundary will move and some \\npoints which were previously misclassified will become correctly classified (and \\nvice versa) so that the set of patterns which contribute to the sum in (3.67) will \\nchange. The perceptron criterion is therefore continuous and piecewise linear \\nwith discontinuities in its gradient. 100 3: Single-Layer Networks \\n3.5.2 Perceptron learning \\nIf we apply the pattern-by-pattern gradient descent rule (3.54) to the perceptron \\ncriterion (3.67) we obtain \\nw<r+1> = w« + nW1.

Cycle through all of the patterns in the training set and test each \\npattern in turn using the current set of weight values. If the pattern is correctly \\nclassified do nothing, otherwise add the pattern vector (multiplied by 77) to the \\nweight vector if the pattern is labelled class C\\\\ or subtract the pattern vector \\n(multiplied by n) from the weight vector if the pattern is labelled class C^.

To see this, recall', 'that the location of the decision boundary is given by (3.2), and is therefore \\nunchanged if all of the weights, including the bias, are rescaled by the same \\nconstant. Thus, when minimizing the perceptron criterion, we can take r\\\\ = 1 \\nwith no loss of generality. This property does not hold, however, for most other \\nforms of error function. \\nIn Figures 3.11-3.13 we give a simple example of learning in a perceptron, for \\nthe case of one basis function <pi, so that, with biases included as special cases of \\nthe weights, the data points live in a two-dimensional space (0o,<£i) with <f>o = 1. \\n3.5.3 Perceptron convergence theorem \\nThere is an interesting result which states that, for any data set which is linearly \\nseparable, the learning rule in (3.68) is guaranteed to find a solution in a finite \\nnumber of steps (Rosenblatt, 1962; Block, 1962; Nilsson, 1965; Minsky and Pa-\\npert, 1969; Duda and Hart, 1973; Hand, 1981; Arbib, 1987; Hertz et al., 1991).', 'This is known as the perceptron convergence theorem. Here we give a relatively \\nsimple proof, based on Hertz et al. (1991). \\nSince we are considering a data set which is linearly separable, we know \\nthat there exists at least one weight vector w for which all training vectors are \\ncorrectly classified, so that \\nwT4>ntn > 0 for all n.

From (3.71) we have 3.5: The perceptron 103 \\n||W(T+1>||2 = ||w«||2 + \\\\\\\\<pnf(tnf + 2w(T)Tft\" \\n<||wW||2 + ||^n||2(tn)2 (3.74) \\nwhere the inequality follows from the fact that the pattern </>\" must have been \\nmisclassified, and so -w^r(f>ntn < 0. We also have (tn)2 = 1 since tn = ±1, and \\n||<£n||2 < ll^llmax where ||<£||max is the length of the longest input vector. Thus, \\nthe change in the value of ||w||2 satisfies \\nA||w||2 S Hw\\'^ll2 - ||wM||2 < ||«£||Lx (3.75) \\nand so after r weight vector updates we have \\nIMP < rlMlLx (3.76) \\nand so the length ||w|| of the weight vector increases no faster than T1/2. We', 'now recall the previous result that wTw is bounded below by a linear function \\nof T. Since w is fixed, we see that for sufficiently large r these two results would \\nbecome incompatible. Thus T cannot grow indefinitely, and so the algorithm \\nmust converge in a finite number of steps. \\nOne of the difficulties with the perceptron learning rule is that, if the data \\nset happens not to be linearly separable, then the learning algorithm will never \\nterminate. Furthermore, if we arbitrarily stop the learning process there is no \\nguarantee that the weight vector found will generalize well for new data. Various \\nheuristics have been proposed with a view to giving good performance on prob\\xad\\nlems which are not linearly separable while still ensuring convergence when the \\nproblem is linearly separable. For example, the value of the parameter T? may be \\nmade to decrease during the learning process so that the corrections gradually', 'become smaller. One approach is to take n = K/r where K is a constant and T is \\nthe step number, by analogy with the Robbins-Monro procedure (Section 2.4.1). \\nAn alternative algorithm for finding good solutions on problems which are not \\nlinearly separable, called the pocket algorithm, is described in Section 9.5.1. As \\nwe have already discussed, the issue of linear separability is a somewhat arti\\xad\\nficial one, and it is more important to develop learning algorithms which can \\nbe expected to give good performance across a wide range of problems, even if \\nthis means sacrificing the guarantee of perfect classification for linearly separable \\nproblems. \\n3.5.4 Limitations of the perceptron \\nWhen perceptrons were being studied experimentally in the 1960s, it was found \\nthat they could solve many problems very readily, whereas other problems, which \\nsuperficially appeared to be no more difficult, proved impossible to solve. A crit\\xad', \"ical appraisal of the capabilities of these networks, from a formal mathematical \\nviewpoint, was given by Minsky and Papert (1969) in their book Perceptrons. 104 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nThey showed that there are many types of problem which a perceptron cannot, \\nin any practical sense, be used to solve. In this context a solution is taken to be \\na correct classification of all of the patterns in the training set. \\nMany recent textbooks on neural networks have summarized Minsky and \\nPapert's contribution by pointing out that a single-layer network can only classify \\ndata sets which are linearly separable, and hence can not solve problems such as \\nthe XOR example considered earlier. In fact, the arguments of Minsky and Papert \\nare rather more subtle, and shed light on the nature of multi-layer networks in \\nwhich only one of the layers of weights is adaptive. Consider the perceptron \\nshown in Figure 3.10. The first layer of fixed (non-adaptive) processing units\", 'computes a set of functions <j>j whose values depend on the input pattern. Even \\nthough the data set of input patterns may not be linearly separable, when viewed \\nin the space of original input variables, it can easily be the case that the same \\nset of patterns becomes linearly separable when transformed into the space of \\n4>j values. Thus a perceptron can solve a linearly inseparable problem, provided \\nit has an appropriate set of first-layer processing elements. \\nThe real difficulty with the perceptron arises from the fact that these pro\\xad\\ncessing elements are fixed in advance and cannot be adapted to the particular \\nproblem (or data set) which is being considered. As a consequence of this, it turns \\nout that the number, or complexity, of such units must grow very rapidly (typi\\xad\\ncally exponentially) with the dimensionality of the problem if the perceptron is \\nto remain capable in general of providing a solution. It is therefore necessary to', 'limit either the number or the complexity of the first-layer units. Minsky and \\nPapert discuss a range of different forms of perceptron (depending on the form \\nof the functions 4>j) and for each of them they provide examples of problems \\nwhich cannot be solved. \\nHere we consider one particular form, called a diameter-limited perceptron, \\nin which we consider two-dimensional input images as shown in Figure 3.10, and \\nin which each of the <pj takes its inputs only from within a small localized region \\nof the image, called a receptive field, having fixed diameter. Minsky and Papert \\n(1969) provide a simple geometrical proof that such a perceptron cannot solve a \\nsimple problem involving the determination of whether a binary geometrical im\\xad\\nage is simply connected. This is illustrated in Figure 3.14. We shall suppose that \\nconnected shapes are labelled with targets +1 and that disconnected shapes have \\ntargets — 1. Note that the overall length of the shapes is taken to be much larger', \"than the maximum diameter of the receptive fields (indicated by the dashed cir\\xad\\ncles) , so that no single receptive field can overlap both ends of the shape. For the \\nshape in Figure 3.14 (a), the functions 4>j and the adaptive weights in the per\\xad\\nceptron must be such that the linear sum which forms the input to the threshold \\nfunction is negative, if this figure is to be correctly classified as 'disconnected'. \\nIn going to 3.14 (b), only the left-hand end of the shape has changed, so the \\nreceptive fields which lie in this region, and their corresponding weights, must \\nbe such that the linear sum is increased sufficiently to make it go positive, since \\nthis shape is 'connected'. Similarly, in going from 3.14 (a) to 3.14 (c) the linear \\nsum must also be increased sufficiently to make it positive. However, in going S.6: Fisher's linear discriminant 105 \\n1 \\n1 <b> 1 \\n1 (c) (d) \\nFigure 3.14. An example of a simple problem, involving the determination of\", 'whether a geometrical figure is simply connected, which cannot be solved by \\na perceptron whose inputs are taken from regions of limited diameter. \\nfrom 3.14 (a) to 3.14 (d), both ends of the shape have been changed in this way, \\nand so the linear sum must be even more positive. This is inevitable since the \\ndiameter limitation means that the response due to the two ends of the shape are \\nindependent. Thus, the linear sum cannot be negative for the shape in 3.14 (d), \\nwhich will therefore be misclassified. \\nVarious alternative approaches to limiting the complexity of the first-layer \\nunits can be considered. For instance, in an order-limited perceptron, each of the \\n<pj can take inputs only from a limited number of input pixels (which may lie \\nanywhere on the input image). Counter-examples similar to the one presented \\nabove can be found also for these other choices of <f>j. These difficulties can be \\ncircumvented by allowing the number and complexity of the <j>j to grow suffi\\xad', \"ciently rapidly with the dimensionality of the problem. For example, it is shown \\nin Section 4.2.1 that, for networks with binary inputs, there is a simple proce\\xad\\ndure for constructing the <j>j such that any set of input patterns is guaranteed to \\nbe linearly separable in the <pj space. The number of such units, however, must \\ngrow exponentially with the input dimensionality. Such an approach is therefore \\ntotally impractical for anything other than toy problems. \\nThe practical solution to these difficulties is to allow the functions <j>j to be \\nadaptive, so that they are chosen as part of the learning process. This leads to a \\nconsideration of multi-layer adaptive networks, as discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. \\n3.6 Fisher's linear discriminant \\nAs the final topic of this chapter we consider a rather different approach to lin\\xad\\near discriminants, introduced by Fisher (1936). In Section 1.4 we encountered \\nthe problem of the 'curse of dimensionality' whereby the design of a good clas\\xad\", 'sifier becomes rapidly more difficult as the dimensionality of the input space 1 \\\\ \\nI 106 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nincreases. One way of dealing with this problem is to pre-process the data so \\nas to reduce its dimensionality before applying a classification algorithm. The \\nFisher discriminant aims to achieve an optimal linear dimensionality reduction. \\nIt is therefore not strictly a discriminant itself, but it can easily be used to \\nconstruct a discriminant. As well as being an important technique in its own \\nright, the Fisher discriminant provides insight into the representations learned \\nby multi-layer networks, as discussed in Section 6.6.1. \\n3.6.1 Two classes \\nOne very simple approach to dimensionality reduction, motivated by our earlier \\ndiscussion of single-layer networks, is to use a linear projection of the data onto \\na one-dimensional space, so that an input vector x is projected onto a value y \\ngiven by \\ny = wTx (3.77)', 'where, as before, w is a vector of adjustable weight parameters. Note that this \\nexpression does not contain any bias parameter. We shall return to this point \\nshortly. In general, the projection onto one dimension leads to a considerable loss \\nof information, and classes which are well separated in the original d-dimensional \\nspace may become strongly overlapping in one dimension. However, by adjusting \\nthe components of the weight vector w we can select a projection which maxi\\xad\\nmizes the class separation. To begin with, consider a two-class problem in which \\nthere are Ni points of class C\\\\ and N2 points of class C2. The mean vectors of \\nthe two classes are given by \\n»» = jz £*\"• m2 = k £x\"- (3-78) \\nWe might think of defining the separation of the classes, when projected onto \\nw, as being the separation of the projected class means. This suggests that we \\nmight choose w so as to maximize \\nm,2 — m\\\\ = wT(rri2 — mi) (3.79) \\nwhere \\nmfc = wTmfc (3.80)', \"is the class mean of the projected data from class Ck- However, this expression \\ncan be made arbitrarily large simply by increasing the magnitude of w. To solve \\nthis problem, we could constrain w to have unit length, so that ]T^ w\\\\ — 1. Using \\na Lagrange multiplier (Appendix C) to perform the constrained maximization \\nwe then find that w cc (rri2 — mi). There is still a problem with this approach, 3.6: Fisher's linear discriminant 107 \\niv \\n..^--rrr^mi P c \\ni \\nl-<:-^r7T^m2^^> \\n! ! v \\nFigure 3.15. A schematic illustration of why it is important to take account of \\nthe within-class covariances when constructing the Fisher linear discriminant \\ncriterion. Projection of the data onto the xi-axis leads to greater separation \\nof the projected class means than does projection onto the X2-axis, and yet it \\nleads to greater class overlap. The problem is resolved by taking account of \\nthe within-class scatter of the data points.\", \"however, as illustrated in Figure 3.15. This shows two classes which are well \\nseparated in the original two-dimensional space {x\\\\,X2)- We see that projection \\nonto the £i-axis gives a much larger separation of the projected class means \\nthan does projection onto the 2,'2-axis. Nevertheless, separation of the projected \\ndata is much better when the data is projected onto the X2-axis than when it is \\nprojected onto the xi-axis. This difficulty arises from the substantial difference \\nof the within-class spreads along the two axis directions. The resolution proposed \\nby Fisher is to maximize a function which represents the difference between the \\nprojected class means, normalized by a measure of the within-class scatter along \\nthe direction of w. \\nThe projection formula (3.77) transforms the set of labelled data points in x \\ninto a labelled set in the one-dimensional space y. The within-class scatter of the\", 'transformed data from class Ck is described the within-class covariance, given by \\nnECk (3.81) \\nand we can define the total within-class covariance for the whole data set to be \\nsimply s\\\\ + s\\\\. We therefore arrive at the Fisher criterion given by \\nJ(w) = (?n2 - mi)2 \\n(3.82) \\nWe can make the dependence on w explicit by using (3.77), (3.80) and (3.81) to \\nrewrite the Fisher criterion in the form 108 3: Single-Layer Networks \\nwTSBw \\nwhere SB is the between-class covariance matrix and is given by \\nSB = (m2 - m1)(m2 - m1)T (3.84) \\nand S\\\\y is the total within-class covariance matrix, given by \\nSW = J2 (x\" - miKx\" - mi)T + E (x\" - m«Kx\" - m2)T (3-85) n6Ci n6C2 \\nDifferentiating (3.83) with respect to w, we find that J(w) is maximized when \\n(wTSBw)Sww = (wTS^w)SBw. (3.86) \\nFrom (3.84) we see that Sgw is always in the direction of (rri2 — mi). Further\\xad\\nmore, we do not care about the magnitude of w, only its direction. Thus, we can', \"drop any scalar factors. Multiplying both sides of (3.86) by Sjy we then obtain \\nw«S^(m2-mi). (3.87) \\nThis is known as Fisher's linear discriminant, although strictly it is not a dis\\xad\\ncriminant but rather a specific choice of direction for projection of the data down \\nto one dimension. Note that, if the within-class covariance is isotropic, so that \\nSiy is proportional to the unit matrix, we find that w is proportional to the \\ndifference of the class means, as discussed above. The projected data can sub\\xad\\nsequently be used to construct a discriminant, by choosing a threshold J/O so \\nthat we classify a new point as belonging to C\\\\ if y(x) > J/O, and classify it as \\nbelonging to C2 otherwise. In doing this we note that y = wTx is the sum of \\na set of random variables, and so we may invoke the central limit theorem (see \\npage 37) and model the class-conditional density functions p(y\\\\Ck) using normal \\ndistributions. The techniques of Chapter 2 can then be used to find the param\\xad\", \"eters of the normal distributions by maximum likelihood, and the formalism of \\nChapter 1 then gives an expression for the optimal threshold. \\nOnce we have obtained a suitable weight vector and a threshold, the proce\\xad\\ndure for deciding the class of a new vector is identical to that of the perceptron \\nnetwork of Section 3.5. We can therefore view the Fisher criterion as a specific \\nprocedure for choosing the weights (and subsequently the bias) in a single-layer \\nnetwork. More conventionally, however, it is regarded as a technique for dimen\\xad\\nsionality reduction, a subject which is discussed at greater length in Chapter 8. In \\nreducing the dimensionality of the data we are discarding information, and this \\ncannot reduce (and will typically increase) the theoretical minimum achievable \\nerror rate. Dimensionality reduction may be worthwhile in practice, however, as S.6: Fisher's linear discriminant 109 \\nit alleviates problems associated with the curse of dimensionality. Thus, with\", 'finite-sized data sets, reduction of the dimensionality may well lead to overall \\nimprovements in the performance of a classifier system. \\n3.6.2 Relation to the least-squares approach \\nThe least-squares approach to the determination of a linear discriminant was \\nbased on the goal of making the network outputs as close as possible to a set of \\ntarget values. By contrast, the Fisher criterion was derived by requiring maxi\\xad\\nmum class separation in the output space. It is interesting to see the relationship \\nbetween these two approaches. In particular, we shall show that, for the two-class \\nproblem, the Fisher criterion can be obtained as a special case of least squares. \\nSo far we have taken the target values to be +1 for class C\\\\ and —1 for \\nclass C%. If, however, we adopt a slightly different target coding scheme then the \\nleast-squares solution solution for the weights becomes equivalent to the Fisher \\nsolution (Duda and Hart, 1973). In particular, we shall take the targets for class', 'C\\\\ to be N/Ni, where Ni is the number of patterns in class C\\\\, and N is the \\ntotal number of patterns. This target value approximates the reciprocal of the \\nprior probability for class C\\\\.

Such networks have a number of important limitations in terms \\nof the range of functions which they can represent. To allow for more general map\\xad\\npings we might consider successive transformations corresponding to networks \\nhaving several layers of adaptive weights. In fact we shall see that networks with \\njust two layers of weights are capable of approximating any continuous functional \\nmapping. More generally we can consider arbitrary network diagrams (not nec\\xad\\nessarily having a simple layered structure) since any network diagram can be \\nconverted into its corresponding mapping function. The only restriction is that \\nthe diagram must be feed-forward, so that it contains no feedback loops. This', 'ensures that the network outputs can be calculated as explicit functions of the \\ninputs and the weights. \\nWe begin this chapter by reviewing the representational capabilities of multi-\\nlayered networks having either threshold or sigmoidal activation functions. Such \\nnetworks are generally called multi-layer perceptrons, even when the activation \\nfunctions are sigmoidal. For networks having differentiable activation functions, \\nthere exists a powerful and computationally efficient method, called error back-\\npropagation, for finding the derivatives of an error function with respect to the \\nweights and biases in the network. This is an important feature of such networks \\nsince these derivatives play a central role in the majority of training algorithms \\nfor multi-layered networks, and we therefore discuss back-propagation at some \\nlength. We also consider a variety of techniques for evaluating and approximating', 'the second derivatives of an error function. These derivatives form the elements \\nof the Hessian matrix, which has a variety of different applications in the context \\nof neural networks. \\n4.1 Feed-forward network mappings \\nIn the first three sections of this chapter we consider a variety of different kinds \\nof feed-forward network, and explore the limitations which exist on the mappings \\nwhich they can generate. We are only concerned in this discussion with finding \\nfundamental restrictions on the capabilities of the networks, and so we shall for \\ninstance assume that arbitrarily large networks can be constructed if needed. In \\npractice, we must deal with networks of a finite size, and this raises a number of \\nimportant issues which are discussed in later chapters. 4-1: Feed-forward network mappings 117 \\noutputs \\nbias \\nXQ XI Xj \\ninputs \\nFigure 4.1. An example of a feed-forward network having two layers of adaptive', 'weights. The bias parameters in the first layer are shown as weights from an \\nextra input having a fixed value of xQ = 1. Similarly, the bias parameters in the \\nsecond layer are shown as weights from an extra hidden unit, with activation \\nagain fixed at zo = 1. \\nWe shall view feed-forward neural networks as providing a general framework \\nfor representing non-linear functional mappings between a set of input variables \\nand a set of output variables. This is achieved by representing the non-linear \\nfunction of many variables in terms of compositions of non-linear functions of \\na single variable, called activation functions. Each multivariate function can be \\nrepresented in terms of a network diagram such that there is a one-to-one corre\\xad\\nspondence between components of the function and the elements of the diagram. \\nEqually, any topology of network diagram, provided it is feed-forward, can be \\ntranslated into the corresponding mapping function. We can therefore catego\\xad', 'rize different network functions by considering the structure of the corresponding \\nnetwork diagrams. \\n4.1.1 Layered networks \\nWe begin by looking at networks consisting of successive layers of adaptive \\nweights. As discussed in Chapter 3, single-layer networks are based on a linear \\ncombination of the input variables which is transformed by a non-linear activa\\xad\\ntion function. We can construct more general functions by considering networks \\nhaving successive layers of processing units, with connections running from every \\nunit in one layer to every unit in the next layer, but with no other connections \\npermitted. Such layered networks are easier to analyse theoretically than more \\ngeneral topologies, and can often be implemented more efficiently in a software \\nsimulation. \\nAn example of a layered network is shown in Figure 4.1. Note that units \\nwhich are not treated as output units are called hidden units. In this network', \"there are d inputs, M hidden units and c output units. We can write down the \\nanalytic function corresponding to Figure 4.1 as follows. The output of the jth hidden \\nunits 118 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nhidden unit is obtained by first forming a weighted linear combination of the d \\ninput values, and adding a bias, to give \\n°j = itwj\\\\)xi + *>jo- (4-1) \\nHere w^' denotes a weight in the first layer, going from input i to hidden unit \\nj, and Wj0 denotes the bias for hidden unit j. As with the single-layer networks \\nof Chapter 3, we have made the bias terms for the hidden units explicit in the \\ndiagram of Figure 4.1 by the inclusion of an extra input variable xo whose value \\nis permanently set at xo = 1. This can be represented analytically by rewriting \\n(4.1) in the form \\nd \\na, = 5>j«V (4.2) <=o \\nThe activation of hidden unit j is then obtained by transforming the linear sum \\nin (4.2) using an activation function g(-) to give \\nZj = g(a}). (4.3)\", 'In this chapter we shall consider two principal forms of activation function \\ngiven respectively by the Heaviside step function, and by continuous sigmoidal \\nfunctions, as introduced already in the context of single-layer networks in Sec\\xad\\ntion 3.1.3. \\nThe outputs of the network are obtained by transforming the activations of \\nthe hidden units using a second layer of processing elements. Thus, for each \\noutput unit k, we construct a linear combination of the outputs of the hidden \\nunits of the form \\nM \\nj=i \\nAgain, we can absorb the bias into the weights to give \\nM \\n«* = 5>i^ (4-5) \\nwhich can be represented diagrammatically by including an extra hidden unit \\nwith activation zo = 1 as shown in Figure 4.1. The activation of the A;th output \\nunit is then obtained by transforming this linear combination using a non-linear 4-1: Feed-forward network mappings 119 \\nactivation function, to give \\nVk = g((ik). : (4.6) .', 'Here we have used the notation #(•) for the activation function of the output \\nunits to emphasize that this need not be the same function as used for the \\nhidden units. \\nIf we combine (4.2), (4.3), (4.5) and (4.6) we obtain an explicit expression for \\nthe complete function represented by the network diagram in Figure 4.1 in the \\nform \\nWe note that, if the activation functions for the output units are taken to be \\nlinear, so that g(a) = a, this functional form becomes a special case of the \\ngeneralized linear discriminant function discussed in Section 3.3, in which the \\nbasis functions are given by the particular functions Zj defined by (4.2) and \\n(4.3). The crucial difference is that here we shall regard the weight parameters \\nappearing in the first layer of the network, as well as those in the second layer, \\nas being adaptive, so that their values can be changed during the process of \\nnetwork training. \\nThe network of Figure 4.1 corresponds to a transformation of the input vari\\xad', 'ables by two successive single-layer networks. It is clear that we can extend this \\nclass of networks by considering further successive transformations of the same \\ngeneral kind, corresponding to networks with extra layers of weights. Through\\xad\\nout this book, when we use the term L-layer network we shall be referring to \\na network with L layers of adaptive weights. Thus we shall call the network of \\nFigure 4.1 a two-layer network, while the networks of Chapter 3 are called single-\\nlayer networks. It should be noted, however, that an alternative convention is \\nsometimes also found in the literature. This counts layers of units rather than \\nlayers of weights, and regards the inputs as separate units. According to this \\nconvention the networks of Chapter 3 would be called two-layer networks, and \\nthe network in Figure 4.1 would be said to have three layers. We do not recom\\xad\\nmend this convention, however, since it is the layers of adaptive weights which', 'are crucial in determining the properties of the network function. Furthermore, \\nthe circles representing inputs in a network diagram are not true processing units \\nsince their sole purpose is to represent the values of the input variables. \\nA useful technique for visualization of the weight values in a neural network \\nis the Hinton diagram, illustrated in Figure 4.2. Each square in the diagram cor\\xad\\nresponds to one of the weight or bias parameters in the network, and the squares \\nare grouped into blocks corresponding to the parameters associated with each \\nunit.

We shall, however, restrict our attention to the \\ncase of feed-forward networks. These have the property that- there are no feed\\xad\\nback loops in the network. In general we say that a network is feed-forward if it \\nis possible to attach successive numbers to the inputs and to all of the hidden \\nand output units such that each unit only receives connections from inputs or \\nunits having a smaller number. An example of a general feed-forward network \\nis shown in Figure 4.3. Such networks have the property that the outputs can \\nbe expressed as deterministic functions of the inputs, and so the whole network \\nrepresents a multivariate non-linear functional mapping.', 'The procedure for translating a network diagram into the corresponding \\nmathematical function follows from a straightforward extension of the ideas \\nalready discussed. Thus, the output of unit k is obtained by transforming a \\nweighted linear sum with a non-linear activation function to give \\n2fc = 9 \\\\YlWkizi (4.8) \\nwhere the sum runs over all inputs and units which send connections to unit k \\n(and a bias parameter is included in the summation). For a given set of values \\napplied to the inputs of the network, successive use of (4.8) allows the activations \\nof all units in the network to be evaluated including those of the output units. \\nThis process can be regarded as a forward propagation of signals through the 4.k: Thre&hoia ur.its 111 \\ninputs \\nFigure 4.3. An example of a neural network having a general feed-forward \\ntopology. Note that each unit has an associated bias parameter, which has \\nbeen omitted from the diagram for clarity.', 'network. In practice, there is little call to consider random networks,, but there \\nis often considerable advantage in building a lot of structure into the network. \\nAn example involving multiple layers of processing units, with highly restricted \\nand structured interconnections between the layers, is discussed in Section 8.7.3. \\nNote that, if the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are \\ntaken to be linear, then for any such network we can always find an equivalent \\nnetwork without hidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of \\nsuccessive linear transformations is itself a linear transformation. Note, however, \\nthat if the number of hidden units is smaller than either the number of input or \\noutput units, then the linear transformation which the network generates is not \\nthe most general possible since information is lost in the dimensionality reduction \\nat the hidden units. In Section 8.6.2 it is shown that such networks can be related', 'to conventional data processing techniques such as principal component analysis. \\nIn general, however, there is little interest in multi-layer linear networks, and we \\nshall therefore mainly consider networks for which the hidden unit activation \\nfunctions are non-linear. \\n4.2 Threshold units \\nThere are many possible choices for the non-linear activation functions in a multi-\\nlayered network, and the choice of activation functions for the hidden units may \\noften be different from that for the output units. This is because hidden and \\noutput units perform different roles, as is discussed at length in Sections 6.6.1 \\nand 6.7.1. However, we begin by considering networks in which all units have \\nHeaviside, or step, activation functions of the form 122 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\n, , f 0 when a < 0 ,. _, \\n•9(a) = {l whena>0. (49) \\nSuch units are also known as threshold units. We consider separately the cases \\nin which the inputs consist of binary and continuous variables.', '4.2.1 Binary inputs \\nConsider first the case of binary inputs, so that X\\\\ — 0 or 1. Since the network \\noutputs are also 0 or 1, the network is computing a Boolean function. We can \\neasily show that a two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 4.1 can generate \\nany Boolean function, provided the number M of hidden units is sufficiently large \\n(McCulloch and Pitts, 1943). This can be seen by constructing a specific network \\nwhich computes a particular (arbitrary) Boolean function. We first note that for \\nd inputs the total possible number of binary patterns which we have to consider \\nis 2rf. A Boolean function is therefore completely specified once we have given \\nthe output (0 or 1) corresponding to each of the 2d possible input patterns. To \\nconstruct the required network we take one hidden unit for every input pattern \\nwhich has an output target of 1. We then arrange for each hidden unit to respond \\njust to the corresponding pattern. This can be achieved by setting the weight', 'from an input to a given hidden unit to +1 if the corresponding pattern has a \\n1 for that input, and setting the weight to —1 if the pattern has a 0 for that \\ninput. The bias for the hidden unit is set to 1 — b where b is the number of \\nnon-zero inputs for that pattern. Thus, for any given hidden unit, presentation \\nof the corresponding pattern will generate a summed input of b and the unit will \\ngive an output of 1, while any other pattern (including any of the patterns with \\ntarget 0) will give a summed input of at most b — 2 and the unit will have an \\noutput of 0. It is now a simple matter to connect each hidden unit to the output \\nunit with a weight +1. An output bias of —1 then ensures that the output of the \\nnetwork is correct for all patterns. \\nThis construction is of little practical value, since it merely stores a set of \\nbinary relations and has no capability to generalize to new patterns outside the', 'training set (since the training set was exhaustive). It does, however, illustrate the \\nconcept of a template. Each hidden unit acts as a template for the corresponding \\ninput pattern and only generates an output when the input pattern matches the \\ntemplate pattern. \\n4.2.2 Continuous inputs \\nWe now discuss the case of continuous input variables, again for units with \\nthreshold activation functions, and we consider the possible decision boundaries \\nwhich can be produced by networks having various numbers of layers (Lippmann, \\n1987; Lonstaff and Cross, 1987). In Section 3.1 it was shown that a network with \\na single layer of weights, and a threshold output unit, has a decision boundary \\nwhich is a hyperplane. This is illustrated for a two-dimensional input space in \\nFigure 4.4 (a). Now consider networks with two layers of weights. Again, each \\nhidden units divides the input space with a hyperplane, so that it has activation .«*.-..-,»,,«,,.i-jw.>WW<WBf-!t- •\\'. 4--~i(\"**HBf«^^.', '4-2: Threshold units 123 \\n(a) (b) (c) \\nFigure 4.4. Illustration of some possible decision boundaries which can be gen\\xad\\nerated by networks having threshold activation functions and various numbers \\nof layers. Note that, for the two-layer network in (b), a single convex region of \\nthe form shown is not the most general possible. \\n2 = 1 on one side of the hyperplane, and z = 0on the other side. If there are M \\nhidden units and the bias on the output unit is set to —M, then the output unit \\ncomputes a logical AND of the outputs of the hidden units. In other words, the \\noutput unit has an output of 1 only if all of the hidden units have an output of 1. \\nSuch a network can generate decision boundaries which surround a single convex \\nregion of the input space, whose boundary consists of segments of hyperplanes, \\nas illustrated in Figure 4.4 (b). A convex region is defined to be one for which any \\nline joining two points on the boundary of the region passes only through points', 'which lie inside the region. These are not, however, the most general regions \\nwhich can be generated by a two-layer network of threshold units, as we shall \\nsee shortly. \\nNetworks having three layers of weights can generate arbitrary decision re\\xad\\ngions, which may be non-convex and disjoint, as illustrated in Figure 4.4 (c). A \\nsimple demonstration of this last property can be given as follows (Lippmann, \\n1987). Consider a particular network architecture in which, instead of having \\nfull connectivity between adjacent layers as considered so far, the hidden units \\nare arranged into groups of 2d units, where d denotes the number of inputs. The \\ntopology of the network is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The units in each group send \\ntheir outputs to a unit in the second hidden layer associated with that group. \\nEach second-layer unit then sends a connection to the output unit. Suppose the \\ninput space is divided into a fine grid of hypercubes, each of which is labelled as', \"class C\\\\ or Ci- By making the input-space grid sufficiently fine we can approxi\\xad\\nmate an arbitrarily shaped decision boundary as closely as we, wish. One group \\nof first-layer units is assigned to each hypercube which corresponds to class Ci, 124 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\noutput \\ninputs \\nFigure 4.5. Topology of a neural network to demonstrate that networks with \\nthree layers of threshold units can generate arbitrarily complex decision bound\\xad\\naries. Biases have been omitted for clarity. \\nand there are no units corresponding to class C%. Using the 'AND' construction \\nfor two-layer networks discussed above, we now arrange that each second-layer \\nhidden unit generates a 1 only for inputs lying in the corresponding hypercube. \\nThis can be done by arranging for the hyperplanes associated with the first-layer \\nunits in the block to be aligned with the sides of the hypercube. Finally, the \\noutput unit has a bias which is set to —1 so that it computes a logical 'OR'\", \"of the outputs of the second-layer hidden units. In other words the output unit \\ngenerates a 1 whenever one (or more) of the second-layer hidden units does so. If \\nthe output unit activation is 1, this is interpreted as class Cx, otherwise it is inter\\xad\\npreted as class C%. The resulting decision boundary then reflects the (arbitrary) \\nassignment of hypercubes to classes C\\\\ and C%. \\nThe above existence proof demonstrates that feed-forward neural networks \\nwith threshold units can generate arbitrarily complex decision boundaries. The \\nproof is of little practical interest, however, since it requires the decision boundary \\nto be specified in advance, and also it will typically lead to very large networks. \\nAlthough it is 'constructive' in that it provides a set of weights and thresholds \\nwhich generate a given decision boundary, it does not answer the more practical \\nquestion of how to choose an appropriate set of weights and biases for a particular\", \"problem when we are given only a set of training examples and we do not know \\nin advance what 'the optimal decision boundary will be. \\nReturning to networks with two layers of weights, we have already seen how \\nthe AND construction for the output unit allows such a network to generate \\nan arbitrary simply-connected convex decision region.

Note, however, that any given decision boundary can be approximated \\narbitrarily closely by a two-layer network having sigmoidal activation functions, \\nas discussed in Section 4.3.2. \\nSo far we have discussed procedures for generating particular forms of deci\\xad\\nsion boundary. A distinct, though related, issue whether a network can classify \\ncorrectly a given set of data points which have been labelled as belonging to one \\nof two classes (a dichotomy). In Chapter 3 it is shown that a network having a \\nsingle layer of threshold units could classify a set of points perfectly if they were \\nlinearly separable. This would always be the case if the number of data points \\nwas at most equal to d + 1 where d is the dimensionality of the input space. \\nNilsson (1965) showed that, for a set of JV data points, a two-layer network of', \"threshold units with JV — 1 units in the hidden layer could exactly separate an \\narbitrary dichotomy. Baum (1988) improved this result by showing that for JV \\npoints in general position (i.e. excluding exact degeneracies) in <2-dimensional \\nspace, a network with \\\\N/d] hidden units in a single hidden layer could separate \\nthem correctly into two classes. Here 1^/^! denotes the smallest integer which \\nis greater than or equal to N/d. \\n4.3 Sigmoidal units \\nWe turn now to a consideration of multi-layer networks having differentiable \\nactivation functions, and to the problem of representing smooth mappings be\\xad\\ntween continuous variables. In Section 3.1.3 we introduced the logistic sigmoid \\nactivation function, whose outputs lie in the range (0,1), given by \\ng{a) = l (4.10) \\n1 + exp(-a) 4-3: Sigmoidal units 127 \\n1.0 \\n8(a) \\n0.0 \\n-1.0 \\n-3.0 0.0 a 3.0 \\nFigure 4.9. Plot of the 'tanh' activation function given by (4.11).\", \"which is plotted in Figure 3.5. We discuss the motivation for this form of acti\\xad\\nvation function in Sections 3.1.3 and 6.7.1, where we show that the use of such \\nactivation functions on the network outputs plays an important role in allowing \\nthe outputs to be given a probabilistic interpretation. \\nThe logistic sigmoid (4.10) is often used for the hidden units of a multi-layer \\nnetwork. However, there may be some small practical advantage in using a 'tanh' \\nactivation function of the form \\ng(a) = tanh(o) = J~^ (4.11) \\nwhich is plotted in Figure 4.9. Note that (4.11) differs from the logistic function \\nin (4.10) only through a linear transformation. Specifically, an activation function \\ng(a) = tanh(a) is equivalent to an activation function g(a) = 1/(1 + e~n) if we \\napply a linear transformation a — a/2 to the input and a linear transformation \\ng = 2g - 1 to the output. Thus a neural network whose hidden units use the\", \"activation function in (4.11) is equivalent to one with hidden units using (4.10) \\nbut having different values for the weights and biases. Empirically, it is often \\nfound that 'tanh' activation functions give rise to faster convergence of training \\nalgorithms than logistic functions. \\nIn this section we shall consider networks with linear output units. As we \\nshall see, this does not restrict the class of functions which such networks can \\napproximate. The use of sigmoid units at the outputs would limit the range of \\npossible outputs to the range attainable by the sigmoid, and in some cases this \\nwould be undesirable. Even if the desired output always lay within the range \\nof the sigmoid we note that the sigmoid function <?(•) is monotonic, and henro \\nis invertible, and so a desired output of y for a network with sigmoidal output \\nunits is equivalent to a desired output of g~x{y) for a network with linear output 128 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron\", 'units. Note, however, that there are other reasons why we might wish to use \\nnon-linear activation functions at the output units, as discussed in Chapter 6. \\nA sigmoidal hidden unit can approximate a linear hidden unit arbitrarily \\naccurately. This can be achieved by arranging for all of the weights feeding into \\nthe unit, as well as the bias, to be very small, so that the summed input lies on \\nthe linear part of the sigmoid curve near the origin. The weights on the outputs \\nof the unit leading to the next layer of units can then be made correspondingly \\nlarge to re-scale the activations (with a suitable offset to the biases if necessary). \\nSimilarly, a sigmoidal hidden unit can be made to approximate a step function \\nby setting the weights and the bias feeding into that unit to very large values. \\nAs we shall see shortly, essentially any continuous functional mapping can be \\nrepresented to arbitrary accuracy by a network having two layers of weights with', 'sigmoidal hidden units. We therefore know that networks with extra layers of \\nprocessing units also have general approximation capabilities since they contain \\nthe two-layer network as a special case. This follows from the fact that the \\nremaining layers can be arranged to perform linear transformations as discussed \\nabove, and the identity transformation is a special case of a linear transformation \\n(provided there is a sufficient number of hidden units so that no reduction in \\ndimensionality occurs). Nevertheless, it is instructive to begin with a discussion \\nof networks having three layers of weights. \\n4.3.1 Three-layer networks \\nIn Section 4.2 we gave a heuristic proof that a three-layer network with threshold \\nactivation functions could represent an arbitrary decision boundary to arbitrary \\naccuracy. In the same spirit we can give an analogous proof that a network with \\nthree layers of weights and sigmoidal activation functions can approximate, to', 'arbitrary accuracy, any smooth mapping (Lapedes and Farber, 1988). The re\\xad\\nquired network topology has the same form as in Figure 4.5, with each group of \\nunits in the first hidden layer again containing 2d units, where d is the dimen\\xad\\nsionality of the input space. As we did for threshold units, we try to arrange for \\neach, group to provide a non-zero output only when the input vector lies within \\na small region of the input space. For this purpose it is convenient to consider \\nthe logistic sigmoid activation function given by (4.10). \\nWe can illustrate the construction of the network by considering a two-\\ndimensional input space. In Figure 4.10 (a) we show the output from a single \\nunit in the first hidden layer, given by \\nz = s(wTx + w0). (4.12) \\nFrom the discussion in Section 3.1, we see that the orientation of the sigmoid is \\ndetermined by the direction of w, its location is determined by the bias WQ, and', 'the steepness of the sigmoid slope is determined by ||w||. Units in the second \\nhidden layer form linear combinations of these sigmoidal surfaces. Consider the \\ncombination of two such surfaces in which we choose the second sigmoid to have \\nthe same orientation as the first but displaced from it by a short distance. By 4-8: Sigmoidal units 129 \\nFigure 4.10. Demonstration that a network with three layers of weights, and \\nsigmoidal hidden units, can approximate a smooth multivariate mapping to \\narbitrary accuracy. In (a) we see the output of a single sigmoidal unit as a \\nfunction of two input variables. Adding the outputs from two such units can \\nproduce a ridge-like function (b), and adding two ridges can give a function \\nwith a maximum (c). Transforming this function with another sigmoid gives a \\nlocalized response (d). By taking linear combinations of these localized func\\xad\\ntions, we can approximate any smooth functional mapping.', \"adding the two sigmoids together we obtain a ridge-like function as shown in \\nFigure 4.10 (b). We next construct d of these ridges with orthogonal orientations \\nand add them together to give a bump-like structure as shown in Figure 4.10 (c). \\nAlthough this has a central peak there are also many other ridges present which \\nstretch out to infinity. These are removed by the action of the sigmoids of the \\nsecond-layer units which effectively provide a form of soft threshold to isolate \\nthe central bump, as shown in Figure 4.10 (d). We now appeal to the intuitive \\nidea (discussed more formally in Section 5.2) that any reasonable function can \\nbe approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear superposition of a sufficiently \\nlarge number of localized 'bump' functions, provided the coefficients in the linear \\ncombination are appropriately chosen. This superposition is performed by the \\noutput unit, which has a linear activation function.\", 'Once again, although this is a constructive algorithm it is of little relevance to \\npractical applications and serves mainly as an existence proof. However, the idea \\nof representing a function as a linear superposition of localized bump functions \\nsuggests that we might consider two-layer networks in which each hidden unit \\ngenerates a bump-like function directly. Such networks are called local basis 130 J,: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nfunction networks, and will be considered in detail in Chapter 5. \\n4.3.2 Two-layer networks \\nWe turn next to the question of the capabilities of networks having two layers of \\nweights and sigmoidal hidden units. This has proven to be an important class of \\nnetwork for practical applications. The general topology is shown in Figure 4.1, \\nand the network function was given explicitly in (4.7). We shall see that such \\nnetworks can approximate arbitrarily well any functional (one-one or many-one)', 'continuous mapping from one finite-dimensional space to another, provided the \\nnumber M of hidden units is sufficiently large. \\nA considerable number of papers have appeared in the literature discussing \\nthis property including Funahashi (1989), Hecht-Nielsen (1989), Cybenko (1989), \\nHornik et al. (1989), Stinchecombe and White (1989), Cotter (1990), Ito (1991), \\nHornik (1991) and Kreinovich (1991). An important corollary of this result is \\nthat, in the context of a classification problem, networks with sigmoidal non-\\nlinearities and two layers of weights can approximate any decision boundary to \\narbitrary accuracy. Thus, such networks also provide universal non-linear dis\\xad\\ncriminant functions. More generally, the capability of such networks to approx\\xad\\nimate general smooth functions allows them to model posterior probabilities of \\nclass membership. \\nHere we outline a simple proof of the universality property (Jones, 1990; Blum', \"and Li, 1991). Consider the case of two input variables X\\\\ and x,2, and a single \\noutput variable y (the extension to larger numbers of input or output variables \\nis straightforward). We know that, for any given value of xi, the desired function \\ny(xy,X2) can be approximated to within any given (sum-of-squares) error by a \\nFourier decomposition in the variable X2, giving rise to terms of the form \\ny(x1,x2)2i'*r,A!l(xi)cos(sx2) (413) \\n5 \\nwhere the coefficients As are functions of x\\\\. Similarly, the coefficients themselves \\ncan be expressed in terms of a Fourier series giving \\ny(x\\\\,x2) c^]P^,4s;cos(te1)cos(.s:r2) (4.14) \\ns I \\nWe can now use the standard trigonometric identity cos a cos 0 — \\\\ cos(a + \\nP) + \\\\ cos(a — 0) to write this as a linear combination of terms of the form \\ncos(zsi) and cos(z'sl) where z,i = lx\\\\ + sx2 and z'sl = Ixi — SX2- Finally, we \\nnote that the function cos(z) can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a\", \"linear combination of threshold step functions. This can be seen by making an \\nexplicit construction, illustrated in Figure 4.11, for a function f(z) in terms of a \\npiecewise constant function, of the form 4.3: Sigmoidal units 131 \\nf(z) \\nrTV —l j >. \\nFigure 4.11. Approximation of a continuous function f(z) by a linear superpo\\xad\\nsition of threshold step functions.

Thus we see that the function y(x-i,X2) \\ncan be expressed as a linear combination of step functions whose arguments are \\nlinear combinations of x\\\\ and xi- In other words the function y(x\\\\,x-i) can be \\napproximated by a two-layer network with threshold hidden units and linear \\noutput units. Finally, we recall that threshold activation functions can be ap\\xad\", \"proximated arbitrarily well by sigmoidal functions, simply by scaling the weights \\nand biases. \\nNote that this proof does not indicate whether the network can simultane\\xad\\nously approximate the derivatives of the function, since our approximation in \\n(4.15) has zero derivative except at discrete points at which the derivative is \\nundefined. A proof that two-layer networks having sigmoidal hidden units can \\nsimultaneously approximate both a function and its derivatives was given by \\nHornik et al. (1990). \\nAs a simple illustration of the capabilities of two-layer networks with sig\\xad\\nmoidal hidden units we consider mappings from a single input x to a' single \\noutput y. In Figure 4.12 we show the result of training a network with five hid\\xad\\nden units having 'tanh' activation functions given by (4.11). The data sets each \\nconsist of 50 data points generated by a variety of functions, and the network \\nhas a single linear output unit and was trained for 1000 epochs using the BFGS\", 'quasi-Newton algorithm described in Section 7.10. We see that the same network \\ncan generate a wide variety of different functions simply by choosing different \\nvalues for the weights and biases. \\nThe above proofs were concerned with demonstrating that a network with a 132 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nEH (a) (b) \\n(c) (d) \\nFigure 4.12. Examples of sets of data points (circles) together with the corre\\xad\\nsponding functions represented by a multi-layer perceptron network which has \\nbeen trained using the data. The data sets were generated by sampling the \\nfollowing functions: (a) x2, (b) sin(2;rx) (c) \\\\x\\\\ which is continuous but with a \\ndiscontinuous first derivative, and (d) the step function 8{x) = sign(a;), which \\nis discontinuous. \\nsufficiently large number of hidden units could approximate a particular map\\xad\\nping. White (1990) and Gallant and White (1992) considered the conditions \\nunder which a network will actually learn a given mapping from a finite data', 'set, showing how the number of hidden units must grow as the size of the data \\nset grows. \\nIf we try to approximate a given function h(x) with a network having a finite \\nnumber M of hidden units, then there will be a residual error. Jones (1992) and \\nBarron (1993) have shown that this error decreases as 0(1/M) as the number \\nM of hidden units is increased. \\nSince we know that, with a single hidden layer, we can approximate any map\\xad\\nping to arbitrary accuracy we might wonder if there is anything to be gained by f \\nusing any other network topology, for instance one having several hidden layers. \\nOne possibility is that by using extra layers we might find more efficient approx\\xad\\nimations in the sense of achieving the same level of accuracy with fewer weights \\nand biases in total. Very little is currently known about this issue. However, \\nlater chapters discuss situations in which there are other good reasons to con\\xad', \"sider networks with more complex topologies, including networks with several \\nhidden layers, and networks with only partial connectivity between layers. 4-4: Weight-space symmetries 133 \\n4.4 Weight-space symmetries \\nConsider a two-layer network having M hidden units, with 'tanh' activation \\nfunctions given by (4.11), and full connectivity in both layers. If we change the \\nsign of all of the weights and the bias feeding into a particular hidden unit, \\nthen, for a given input pattern, the sign of the activation of the hidden unit \\nwill be reversed, since (4.11) is an odd function. This can be compensated by \\nchanging the sign of all of the weights leading out of that hidden unit. Thus, \\nby changing the signs of a particular group of weights (and a bias), the input-\\noutput mapping function represented by the network is unchanged, and so we \\nhave found two different weight vectors which give rise to the same mapping\", \"function. For M hidden units, there will be M such 'sign-flip' symmetries, and \\nthus any given weight vector will be one of a set 2M equivalent weight vectors \\n(Chen et ai, 1993). \\nSimilarly, imagine that we interchange the values of all of the weights (and \\nthe bias) leading into and out of a particular hidden unit with the corresponding \\nvalues of the weights (and bias) associated with a different hidden unit. Again, \\nthis clearly leaves the network input-output mapping function unchanged, but \\nit corresponds to a different choice of weight vector. For M hidden units, any \\ngiven weight vector will have M! equivalent weight vectors associated with this \\ninterchange symmetry, corresponding to the M! different orderings of the hidden \\nunits (Chen et ai, 1993). The network will therefore have an overall weight-space \\nsymmetry factor of M!2M. For networks with more than two layers of weights, \\nthe total level of symmetry will be given by the product of such factors, one for\", \"each layer of hidden units. \\nIt turns out that these factors account for all of the symmetries in weight \\nspace (except for possible accidental symmetries due to specific choices for the \\nweight values). Furthermore, the existence of these symmetries is not a particular \\nproperty of the 'tanh' function, but applies to a wide range of activation functions \\n(Sussmann, 1992; Chen et ai, 1993; Albertini and Sontag, 1993; Kiirkova and \\nKainen, 1994). In many cases, these symmetries in weight space are of little \\npractical consequence. However, we shall encounter an example in Section 10.6 \\nwhere we need to take them into account. \\n4.5 Higher-order networks \\nSo far in this chapter we have considered units for which the output is given by \\na non-linear activation function acting on a linear combination of the inputs of \\nthe form \\na, = 2_2wjixi +Wjo- (4-16) \\ni \\nWe have seen that networks composed of such units can in principle approximate\", 'any functional mapping to arbitrary accuracy, and therefore constitute a univer\\xad\\nsal class of parametrized multivariate non-linear mappings. Nevertheless, there \\nis still considerable interest in studying other forms of processing unit. Chapter 5 134 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\ny(x) \\nFigure 4.13. A one-dimensional input space x with decision regions Ti-t (which \\nis disjoint) and ~R-2- A linear discriminant function cannot generate the required \\ndecision boundaries, but a quadratic discriminant y(x), shown by the solid \\ncurve, can. The required decision rule then assigns an input x to class C\\\\ if \\ny(x) > 0 and to class Ci otherwise. \\nfor instance is devoted to a study of networks containing units whose activations \\ndepend on the distance of an input vector from the weight vector. Here we con\\xad\\nsider some extensions of the linear expression in (4.16) which therefore contain \\n(4.16) as a special case. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, a network consisting of a single layer of units of', 'the form (4.16) can only produce decision boundaries which take the form of \\npiecewise hyperplanes in the input space. Such a network is therefore incapable \\nof generating decision regions which are concave or which are multiply connected. \\nConsider the one-dimensional input space x illustrated in Figure 4.13. We wish to \\nfind a discriminant function which will divide the space into the decision regions \\nTZi and 7?-2 as shown. A linear discriminant function is not sufficient since the \\nregion Hi is disjoint. However, the required decision boundaries can be generated \\nby a quadratic discriminant of the form \\ny(x) — Wix + Mia; + wo (4.17) \\nprovided the weights t02,wi and Wo are chosen appropriately. \\nWe can generalize this idea to higher orders than just quadratic, and to \\nseveral input variables (Ivakhnenko, 1971; Barron and Barron, 1988). This leads \\nto higher-order processing units (Giles and Maxwell, 1987; Ghosh and Shin,', '1992), also known as sigma-pi units (Rumelhart et al, 1986). For second-order \\nunits the generalization of (4.16) takes the form 4-6: Projection pursuit regression 135 \\nd d d \\nwhere the sums run over all inputs, or units, which send connections to unit j. \\nAs before, this sum is then transformed using a non-linear activation function to \\ngive Zj = g(dj). If terms up to degree M are retained, this will be known as on \\nMth-order unit. Clearly (4.18) includes the conventional linear (first-order) unit \\n(4.16) as a special case. The similarity to the higher-order polynomials discussed \\nin Section 1.7 is clear. Note that the summations in (4.18) can be constrained \\nto allow for the permutation symmetry of the higher-order terms. For instance, \\nthe term x^x^ is equivalent to the term x^Xj, and so we need only retain one \\nof these in the summation. The total number of independent parameters in a \\nhigher-order expression such as (4.18) is discussed in Exercises 1.6-1.8.', 'If we introduce an extra input zo = +1 then, for an Mth-order unit we can \\nabsorb all of the terms up to the Mth-order within the Mth-order term. For \\ninstance, if we consider second-order units we can write (4.18) in the equivalent: \\nform \\nd d \\ni,=Ot2=0 \\nwith similar generalizations to higher orders. \\nWe see that there will typically be many more weight parameters in a higher-\\norder unit than there are in a first-order unit. For example, if we consider an \\ninput dimensionality of d = 10 then a first-order unit will have 11 weight param\\xad\\neters (including the bias), a second-order unit will have 66 independent weights, \\nand a third-order unit will have 572 independent weights. This explosion in the \\nnumber of parameters is the principal difficulty with such higher-order units. \\nThe compensating benefit is that it is possible to arrange for the response of the \\nunit to be invariant to various transformations of the input. In Section 8.7.4 it', 'is shown how a third-order unit can be simultaneously invariant to translations. \\nrotations and scalings of the input patterns when these are drawn from pixels \\nin a two-dimensional image. This is achieved by imposing constraints on the \\nweights, which also greatly reduce the number of independent parameters, and \\nthereby makes the use of such units a tractable proposition. Higher-order unit:; \\nare generally used only in the first layer of a network, with subsequent layers \\nbeing composed of conventional first-order units. \\n4.6 Projection pursuit regression and other conventional techniques \\nStatisticians have developed a variety of techniques for classification and regie? \\nsion which can be regarded as complementary to the multi-layer perceptron. Here \\nwe give a brief overview of the most prominent of these approaches, and indi \\ncate their relation to neural networks. One of the most closely related is that of 136 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron', \"projection pursuit regression (Friedman and Stuetzle, 1981; Huber, 1985). For a \\nsingle output variable, the projection pursuit regression mapping can be written \\nin the form \\nM \\ny = '^T Wj(t>j(ujx + uj0) + wo (4.20) \\n3 = 1 \\nwhich is remarkably similar to a two-layer feed-forward neural network. The pa\\xad\\nrameters Uj and MJO define the projection of the input vector x onto a set of \\nplanes labelled by j = 1,..., M, as in the multi-layer perceptron. These projec\\xad\\ntions are transformed by non-linear 'activation functions' (j>j and these in turn \\nare linearly combined to form the output variable y. Determination of the param\\xad\\neters in the model is done by minimizing a sum-of-squares error function. One \\nimportant difference is that each 'hidden unit' in projection pursuit regression \\nis allowed a different activation function, and these functions are not prescribed \\nin advance, but are determined from the data as part of the training procedure.\", 'Another difference is that typically all of the parameters in a neural net\\xad\\nwork are optimized simultaneously, while those in projection pursuit regression \\nare optimized cyclically in groups. Specifically, training in the projection pur\\xad\\nsuit regression network takes place for one hidden unit at a time, and for each \\nhidden unit the second-layer weights are optimized first, followed by the acti\\xad\\nvation function, followed by the first-layer weights. The process is repeated for \\neach hidden unit in turn, until a sufficiently small value for the error function is \\nachieved, or until some other stopping criterion is satisfied. Since the output y in \\n(4.20) depends linearly on the second-layer parameters, these can be optimized \\nby linear least-squares techniques, as discussed in Section 3.4. Optimization of \\nthe activation functions <j>j represents a problem in one-dimensional curve-fitting \\nfor which a variety of techniques can be used, such as cubic splines (Press et', \"al, 1992). Finally, the optimization of the first-layer weights requires non-linear \\ntechniques of the kind discussed in Chapter 7. \\nSeveral generalizations to more than one output variable are possible (Ripley, \\n1994) depending on whether the outputs share common basis functions <pj, and \\nif not, whether the separate basis functions 4>jk (where k labels the outputs) \\nshare common projection directions. In terms of representational capability, we \\ncan regard projection pursuit regression as a generalization of the multi-layer \\nperceptron, in that the activation functions are more flexible. It is therefore not \\nsurprising that projection pursuit regression should have the same 'universal' ap\\xad\\nproximation capabilities as multi-layer perceptrons (Diaconis and Shahshahani, \\n1984; Jones, 1987). Projection pursuit regression is compared with multi-layer \\nperceptron networks in Hwang et al. (1994). \\nAnother framework for non-linear regression is the class of generalized addi\\xad\", \"tive models (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) which take the form 4-7: Kolmogorov's theorem 137 \\ny = 9lj^<l>i(xi)+Wo\\\\ (4.21) \\nwhere the <fo(-) are non-linear functions and g(-) represents the logistic sigmoid \\nfunction (4.10). This is actually a very restrictive class of models, since it does not \\nallow for interactions between the input variables. Thus a function of the form \\n£1X21 for example, cannot be modelled. They do, however, have an advantage in \\nterms of the interpretation of the trained model, since the individual univariate \\nfunctions cpi(-) can be plotted. \\nAn extension of the additive models which allows for interactions is given \\nby the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) (Friedman, \\n1991) for which the mapping function can be written \\nM Kj \\n^E^II <t>jk{xu(k,i)) + ™<> (4.22) \\nwhere the jth basis function is given by a product of some number Kj of one-\\ndimensional spline functions <j>jk (Press et al, 1992) each of which depends on\", 'one of the input variables x„, where the particular input variable used in each \\ncase is governed by a label u(k,j). The basis functions are adaptive in that the \\nnumber of factors Kj, the labels u(k,j), and the knots for the one-dimensional \\nspline functions are all determined from the data. Basis functions are added \\nincrementally during learning, using the technique of sequential forward selection \\ndiscussed in Section 8.5.3. \\nAn alternative framework for learning non-linear multivariate mappings in--\\nvolves partitioning the input space into regions, and fitting a different mapping \\nwithin each region. In many such algorithms, the partitions are formed from \\nhyperplanes which are parallel to the input variable axes, as indicated in Fig\\xad\\nure 4.14. In the simplest case the output variable is taken to be constant within \\neach region. A common technique is to form a binary partition in which the \\ninput space is divided into two regions, and then each of these is divided in turn,', \"and so on. This form of partitioning can then be described by a binary tree \\nstructure, in which each leaf represents one of the regions. Successive branches \\ncan be added to the tree during learning, with the locations of the hyperplanes \\nbeing determined by the data. Procedures are often also devised for pruning the \\ntree structure as a way of controlling the effective complexity of the model. Two \\nof the best known algorithms of this kind are classification and regression trees \\n(CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) and ID3 (Quinlan, 1986). A detailed discussion \\nof these algorithms would, however, take us too far afield. \\n4.7 Kolmogorov's theorem \\nThere is a theorem due to Kolmogorov (1957) which, although of no direct prac\\xad\\ntical significance, does have an interesting relation to neural networks.

Such partitions form the basis of a number \\nof algorithms for solving classification and regression problems. \\nrem has its origins at the end of the nineteenth century when the mathematician \\nHilbert compiled a list of 23 unsolved problems as a challenge for twentieth cen\\xad\\ntury mathematicians (Hilbert, 1900). Hilbert's thirteenth problem concerns the \\nissue of whether functions of several variables can be represented in terms of \\nsuperpositions of functions of fewer variables. He conjectured that there exist \\ncontinuous functions of three variables which cannot be represented as super\\xad\\npositions of functions of two variables. The conjecture was disproved by Arnold \\n(1957). However, a much more general result was obtained by Kolmogorov (1957) \\nwho showed that every continuous function of several variables (for a closed and \\nbounded input domain) can be represented as the superposition of a small num\\xad\", \"ber of functions of one variable. Improved versions of Kolmogorov's theorem have \\nbeen given by Sprecher (1965), Kahane (1975) and Lorentz (1976). In neural net\\xad\\nwork terms this theorem says that any continuous mapping j/(x) from d input \\nvariables Xi to an output variable y can be represented exactly by a three-layer \\nneural network having d(2d + l) units in the first hidden layer and (2d 4-1) units \\nin the second hidden layer. The network topology is illustrated, for the case of \\na single output, in Figure 4.15. Each unit in the first hidden layer computes a \\nfunction of one of the input variables X{ given by hj(xi) where j — 1,..., 2d + 1 \\nand the hj are strictly monotonic functions. The activation of the jth unit in \\nthe second hidden layer is given by \\n^Xihjixi) (4.23) \\nt=i 4-7: Kolmogorov's theorem 139 \\noutput \\ng(Zi) Sfew+i) \\nXu \\n• -/ \\nfh\\\\ /V ... \\nL / KM /x \\n0~~~ h\\\\ \\\\K \\nfh \\ninputs \\nFigure 4.15.

The output y of the network is then given by \\n(4.24) 2d+l \\ny = Yl s(zi) \\nwhere the function g is real and continuous. Note that the function g depends \\non the particular function y(x) which is to be represented, while the functions \\nhj do not.

(4-25) \\n3 = 1 \\nNote that the theorem only guarantees the existence of a suitable network. No ac\\xad\\ntual examples of functions hj or g are known, and there is no known constructive \\ntechnique for finding them. \\nWhile Kolmogorov's theorem is remarkable, its relevance to practical neural \\ncomputing is at best limited (Girosi and Poggio, 1989; Kurkova, 1991; Kurkova, \\n1992): There are two reasons for this. First, the functions hj are far from being \\nsmooth. Indeed, it has been shown that if the functions hj are required to be\", \"smooth then the theorem breaks down (Vitushkin, 1954). The presence of non-\\nsmooth functions in a network would lead to problems of extreme sensitivity 140 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nto the input variables. Smoothness of the network mapping is an important \\nproperty in connection with the generalization performance of a network, as is \\ndiscussed in greater detail in Section 9.2. The second reason is that the function \\ng depends on the particular function y(x) which we wish to represent. This is \\nthe converse of the situation which we generally encounter with neural networks. \\nUsually, we consider fixed activation functions, and then adjust the number of \\nhidden units, and the values of the weights and biases, to give a sufficiently close \\nrepresentation of the desired mapping. In Kolrnogorov's theorem the number of \\nhidden units is fixed, while the activation functions depend on the mapping. In \\ngeneral, if we are trying to represent an arbitrary continuous function then we'\", 'cannot hope to do this exactly with a finite number of fixed activation functions \\nsince the finite number of adjustable parameters represents a finite number of \\ndegrees of freedom, and a general continuous function has effectively infinitely \\nmany degrees of freedom. \\n4.8 Error back-propagation \\nSo far in this chapter we have concentrated on the representational capabilities of \\nmulti-layer networks. We next consider how such a network can learn a suitable \\nmapping from a given data set. As in previous chapters, learning will be based on \\nthe definition of a suitable error function, which is then minimized with respect \\nto the weights and biases in the network. \\nConsider first the case of networks of threshold units. The final layer of \\nweights in the network can be regarded as a perceptron,with inputs given by \\nthe outputs of the last layer of hidden units. These weights could therefore be \\nchosen using the perceptron learning rule introduced in Chapter 3. Such an ap\\xad', 'proach cannot, however, be used to determine the weights in earlier layers of \\nthe network. Although such layers could in principle be regarded as being like \\nsingle-layer perceptrons, we have no procedure for assigning target values to their \\noutputs, and so the perceptron procedure cannot be applied. This is known as \\nthe credit assignment problem. If an output unit produces an incorrect response \\nwhen the network is presented with an input vector we have no way of determin\\xad\\ning which of the hidden units should be regarded as responsible for generating \\nthe error, so there is no way of determining which weights to adjust or by how \\nmuch. \\nThe solution to this credit assignment problem is relatively simple. If we \\nconsider a network with differentiable activation functions, then the activations \\nof the output units become differentiable functions of both the input variables, \\nand of the weights and biases. If we define an error function, such as the sum-of-', 'squares error introduced in Chapter 1, which is a differentiable function of the \\nnetwork outputs, then this error is itself a differentiable function of the weights. \\nWe can therefore evaluate the derivatives of the error with respect to the weights, \\nand these derivatives can then be used to find weight values which minimize the \\nerror function, by using either gradient descent or one of the more powerful \\noptimization methods discussed in Chapter 7. The algorithm for evaluating the \\nderivatives of the error function is known as back-propagation since, as we shall 4-8: Error back-propagation 141 \\nsee, it corresponds to a propagation of errors backwards through the network. \\nThe technique of back-propagation was popularized in a paper by Rumelhart, \\nHinton and Williams (1986). However, similar ideas had been developed earlier \\nby a number of researchers including Werbos (1974) and Parker (1985). \\nIt should be noted that the term back-propagation is used in the neural com\\xad', 'puting literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multi\\xad\\nlayer perceptron architecture is sometimes called a back-propagation network. \\nThe term back-propagation is also used to describe the training of a multi-layer \\nperceptron using gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In \\norder to clarify the terminology it is useful to consider the nature of the training \\nprocess more carefully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure \\nfor minimization of an error function, with adjustments to the weights being \\nmade in a sequence of steps. At each such step we can distinguish between \\ntwo distinct stages. In the first stage, the derivatives of the error function with \\nrespect to the weights must be evaluated. As we shall see, the important con\\xad\\ntribution of the back-propagation technique is in providing a computationally \\nefficient method for evaluating such derivatives. Since it is at this stage that', 'errors are propagated backwards through the network, we shall use the term \\nback-propagation specifically to describe the evaluation of derivatives. In the \\nsecond stage, the derivatives are then used to compute the adjustments to be \\nmade to the weights. The simplest such technique, and the one originally con\\xad\\nsidered by Rumelhart et al. (1986), involves gradient descent. It is important to \\nrecognize that the two stages are distinct. Thus, the first stage process, namely \\nthe propagation of errors backwards through the network in order to evaluate \\nderivatives, can be applied to many other kinds of network and not just the \\nmulti-layer perceptron. It can also be applied to error functions other that just \\nthe simple sum-of-squares, and to the evaluation of other derivatives such as the \\nJacobian and Hessian matrices, as we shall see later in this chapter. Similarly, the \\nsecond stage of weight adjustment using the calculated derivatives can be tack\\xad', 'led using a variety of optimization schemes (discussed at length in Chapter 7), \\nmany of which are substantially more powerful than simple gradient descent. \\n4.8.1 Evaluation of error function derivatives \\nWe now derive the back-propagation algorithm for a general network having \\narbitrary feed-forward topology, and arbitrary differentiable non-linear activation \\nfunctions, for the case of an arbitrary differentiable error function. The resulting \\nformulae will then be illustrated using a simple layered network structure having \\na single layer of sigmoidal hidden units and a sum-of-squares error. \\nIn a general feed-forward network, each unit computes a weighted sum of its \\ninputs of the form \\naj = ]Pu>jjZj (4.26) \\ni \\nwhere z* is the activation of a unit, or input, which sends a connection to unit 142 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nj, and Wji is the weight associated with that connection. The summation runs', 'over all units which send connections to unit j. In Section 4.1 we showed that \\nbiases can be included in this sum by introducing an extra unit, or input, with \\nactivation fixed at +1. We therefore do not need to deal with biases explicitly. \\nThe sum in (4.26) is transformed by a non-linear activation function g(-) to give \\nthe activation Zj of unit j in the form \\nZj = g(aj). (4.27) \\nNote that one or more of the variables Zi in the sum in (4.26) could be an input, \\nin which case we shall denote it by Xi. Similarly, the unit j in (4.27) could be an \\noutput unit, in which case we denote its activation by j/fc. \\nAs before, we shall seek to determine suitable values for the weights in the \\nnetwork by minimization of an appropriate error function. Here we shall consider \\nerror functions which can be written as a sum, over all patterns in the training \\nset, of an error defined for each pattern separately \\nE = Y.E\" (4-28) n', 'where n labels the patterns. Nearly all error functions of practical interest take \\nthis form, for reasons which are explained in Chapter 6. We shall also suppose \\nthat the error En can be expressed as a differentiable function of the network \\noutput variables so that \\nEn = En{yu...,yc). (4.29) \\nOur goal is to find a procedure for evaluating the derivatives of the error function \\nE with respect to the weights and biases in the network. Using (4.28) we can \\nexpress these derivatives as sums over the training set patterns of the derivatives \\nfor each pattern separately. From now on we shall therefore consider one pattern \\nat a time. \\nFor each pattern we shall suppose that we have supplied the corresponding \\ninput vector to the network and calculated the activations of all of the hidden \\nand output units in the network by successive application of (4.26) and (4.27). \\nThis process is often called forward propagation since it can be regarded as a', \"forward flow of information through the network. \\nNow consider the evaluation of the derivative of En with respect to some \\nweight Wji. The outputs of the various units will depend on the particular input \\npattern n. However, in order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall omit \\nthe superscript n from the input and activation variables. First we note that \\nEn depends on the weight Wji only via the summed input aj to unit j. We can \\ntherefore apply the chain rule for partial derivatives to give 4-8: Error back-propagation 143 \\n8En _ dEn da5 \\ndu)ji daj dwji' \\nWe now introduce a useful notation \\ndEn \\n6, S -^ (4.31) \\nwhere the <5's are often referred to as errors for reasons we shall see shortly. Using \\n(4.26) we can write \\n-^L = Zi. (4.32) \\ndwji \\nSubstituting (4.31) and (4.32) into (4.30) we then obtain \\ndEn \\nduiji = 6jZt. (4.33) \\nNote that this has the same general form as obtained for single-layer networks\", \"in Section 3.4. Equation (4.33) tells us that the required derivative is obtained \\nsimply by multiplying the value of 6 for the unit at the output end of the weight \\nby the value of z for the unit at the input end of the weight (where z = 1 in \\nthe case of a bias). Thus, in order to evaluate the derivatives, we need only to \\ncalculate the value of 8j for each hidden and output unit in the network, and \\nthen apply (4.33). \\nFor the output units the evaluation of 6k is straightforward. From the defini\\xad\\ntion (4.31) we have \\n. dEn .dEn \\nwhere we have used (4.27) with Zk denoted by yk- In order to evaluate (4.34) we \\nsubstitute appropriate expressions for g'(a) and dEn/dy. This will be illustrated \\nwith a simple example shortly. \\nTo evaluate the 6's for hidden units we again make use of the chain rule for \\npartial derivatives, \\nwhere the sum runs over all units k to which unit j sends connections. The \\narrangement of units and weights is illustrated in Figure 4.16. Note that the\", \"units labelled k could include other hidden units and/or output units. In writing 144 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nFigure 4.16. Illustration of the calculation of <5, for hidden unit j by back-\\npropagation of the <5's from those units k to which unit j sends connections. \\ndown (4.35) we are making use of the fact that variations in a, give rise to \\nvariations in the error function only through variations in the variables a/t. If we \\nnow substitute the definition of 6 given by (4.31) into (4.35), and make use of \\n(4.26) and (4.27), we obtain the following back-propagation formula \\n6j - g'(aj) ]P WkjSk (4.36) \\nk \\nwhich tells us that the value of 6 for a particular hidden unit can be obtained by \\npropagating the 6's backwards from units higher up in the network, as illustrated \\nin Figure 4.16. Since we already know the values of the 6's for the output units, \\nit follows that by recursively applying (4.36) we can evaluate the 6's for all of\", \"the hidden units in a feed-forward network, regardless of its topology. \\nWe can summarize the back-propagation procedure for evaluating the deriva\\xad\\ntives of the error En with respect to the weights in four steps: \\n1. Apply an input vector xn to the network and forward propagate through \\nthe network using (4.26) and (4.27) to find the activations of all the hidden \\nand output units. \\n2. Evaluate the 6k for all the output units using (4.34). \\n3. Back-propagate the 6's using (4.36) to obtain 6j for each hidden unit in \\nthe network. \\n4. Use (4.33) to evaluate the required derivatives. \\nThe derivative of the total error E can then be obtained by repeating the above \\nsteps for each pattern in the training set, and then summing over all patterns: 4-8: Error back-propagation 145 \\ndE ^ dEn \\ndwu ^ dwii' \\nJ n J \\nIn the above derivation we have implicitly assumed that each hidden or output \\nunit in the network has the same activation function g(-). The derivation is\", \"easily generalized, however, to allow different units to have individual activation \\nfunctions, simply by keeping track of which form of g(-) goes with which unit. \\n4.8.2 A simple example \\nThe above derivation of the back-propagation procedure allowed for general \\nforms for the error function, the activation functions and the network topol\\xad\\nogy. In order to illustrate the application of this algorithm, we shall consider a \\nparticular example. This is chosen both for its simplicity and for its practical \\nimportance, since many applications of neural networks reported in the litera\\xad\\nture make use of this type of network. Specifically, we shall consider a two-layer \\nnetwork of the form illustrated in Figure 4.1, together with a sum-of-squares \\nerror. The output units have linear activation functions while the hidden units \\nhave logistic sigmoid activation functions given by (4.10), and repeated here: \\ng(a) = - -.—r. (4.38) \\nv ' l + exp(-a) v ;\", 'A useful feature of this function is that its derivative can be expressed in a \\nparticularly simple form: \\ng\\'(a) = <?(a)(l - g(a)). (4.39) \\nIn a software implementation of the network algorithm, (4.39) represents a con\\xad\\nvenient property since the derivative of the activation can be obtained efficiently \\nfrom the activation itself using two arithmetic operations. \\nFor the standard sum-of-squares error function, the error for pattern n is \\ngiven by \\nEn = \\\\Y,{yk-tk? (4.40) \\nwhere yk is the response of output unit k, and tk is the corresponding target, for \\na particular input pattern x\". \\nUsing the expressions derived above for back-propagation in a general net\\xad\\nwork, together with (4.39) and (4.40), we obtain the following results. For the \\noutput units, the 6\\'s are given by \\n6k=Vk- h (4.41) 146 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nwhile for units in the hidden layer the <5\\'s are found using \\nc \\nsi = zj (! ~ zi) ]C WkJ6k (4-42)', 'where the sum runs over all output units. The derivatives with respect to the \\nfirst-layer and second-layer weights are then given by \\ndEn gEn \\n•5— = 6jXU = bkZj. (4.43) \\nSo far we have discussed the evaluation of the derivatives of the error function \\nwith respect to the weights and biases in the network. In order to turn this into \\na learning algorithm we need some method for updating the weights based on \\nthese derivatives. In Chapter 7 we discuss several such parameter optimization \\nstrategies in some detail. For the moment, we consider the fixed-step gradient \\ndescent technique introduced in Section 3.4. We have the choice of updating the \\nweights either after presentation of each pattern (on-line learning) or after first \\nsumming the derivatives over all the patterns in the training set (batch learning). \\nIn the former case the weights in the first layer are updated using \\nAniji = -tjSjXi (4.44) \\nwhile in the case of batch learning the first-layer weights are updated using', 'AWji = ~77^«5X (4-45) \\nn \\nwith analogous expressions for the second-layer weights. \\n4.8.3 Efficiency of back-propagation \\nOne of the most important aspects of back-propagation is its computational \\nefficiency. To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer op\\xad\\nerations required to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the \\nsize of the network. Let W be the total number of weights and biases. Then a \\nsingle evaluation of the error function (for a given input pattern) would require \\n0(W) operations, for sufficiently large W. This follows from the fact that, except \\nfor a network with very sparse connections, the number of weights is typically \\nmuch greater than the number of units. Thus, the bulk of the computational \\neffort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluating the sums in (4.26), \\nwith the evaluation of the activation functions representing a small overhead. \\nEach term in the sum in (4.26) requires one multiplication and one addition,', 'leading to an overall computational cost which is 0(W). \\nFor W weights in total there are W such derivatives to evaluate. If we simply 4-8: Error back-propagation 147 \\ntook the expression for the error function and wrote down explicit formulae for \\nthe derivatives and then evaluated them numerically by forward propagation, we \\nwould have to evaluate W such terms (one for each weight or bias) each requiring \\n0{W) operations. Thus, the total computational effort required to evaluate all \\nthe derivatives would scale as OiW\"2). By comparison, back-propagation allows \\nthe derivatives to be evaluated in 0(W) operations. This follows from the fact \\nthat both the forward and the backward propagation phases are 0(W), and the \\nevaluation of the derivative using (4.33) also requires 0(W) operations. Thus \\nback-propagation has reduced the computational complexity from 0(W2) to \\n0(W) for each input vector. Since the training of MLP networks, everi using*', 'back-propagation, can be very time consuming, this gain in efficiency is crucial. . \\nFor a total of N training patterns, the number of computational steps required \\nto evaluate the complete error function for the whole data set is N times larger \\nthan for one pattern. \\nThe practical importance of the 0(W) scaling of back-propagation is anal\\xad\\nogous in some respects to that of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm \\n(Brigham, 1974; Press et al, 1992) which reduces the computational complex\\xad\\nity of evaluating an L-point Fourier transform from 0(L2) to C(Llog2 L). The \\ndiscovery of this algorithm led to the widespread use of Fourier transforms in a \\nlarge range of practical applications. \\n4.8.4 Numerical differentiation \\nAn alternative approach to back-propagation for computing the derivatives of \\nthe error function is to use finite differences. This can be done by perturbing \\neach weight in turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression \\nap^K + c)-^) \\nduiji e', 'where e < 1 is a small quantity. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the \\napproximation to the derivatives can be improved by making e smaller, until \\nnumerical roundoff problems arise. The main problem with this approach is that \\nthe highly desirable 0(W) scaling has been lost. Each forward propagation re\\xad\\nquires 0(W) steps, and there are W weights in the network each of which must \\nbe perturbed individually, so that the overall scaling is OfW2). However, finite \\ndifferences play an important role in practice, since a numerical comparison of \\nthe derivatives calculated by back-propagation with those obtained using finite \\ndifferences provides a very powerful check on the correctness of any software \\nimplementation of the back-propagation algorithm. \\nThe accuracy of the finite differences method can be improved significantly \\nby using symmetrical central differences of the form \\n™1 = E»(Wji + e)-E»(Wji-e) + \\nduiji 2e 148 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron', 'In this case the 0(e) corrections cancel, as is easily verified by Taylor expan\\xad\\nsion on the right-hand side of (4.47), and so the residual corrections are 0(e2). \\nThe number of computational steps is, however, roughly doubled compared with \\n(4.46). \\nWe have seen that the derivatives of an error function with respect to the \\nweights in a network can be expressed efficiently through the relation \\n— - — \\ndwji da,j \\nInstead of using the technique of central differences to evaluate the derivatives \\ndEn/duiji directly, we can use it to estimate dEn/da,j since \\na^i^-^-^.-e) \\noa.j 2e \\nWe can then make use of (4.48) to evaluate the required derivatives. Because the \\nderivatives with respect to the weights are found from (4.48) this approach is \\nstill relatively efficient. Back-propagation requires one forward and one backward \\npropagation through the network, each taking G(W) steps, in order to evaluate \\nall of the dE/ddi. By comparison, (4.49) requires 2M forward propagations,', 'where M is the number of hidden and output nodes. The overall scaling is there\\xad\\nfore proportional to MW, which is typically much less than the 0(W2) scaling \\nof (4.47), but more than the 0(W) scaling of back-propagation. This technique \\nis called node perturbation (Jabri and Flower, 1991), and is closely related to the \\nmadeline III learning rule (Widrow and Lehr, 1990). \\nIn a software implementation, derivatives should be evaluated using back-\\npropagation, since this gives the greatest accuracy and numerical efficiency. How\\xad\\never, the results should be compared with numerical differentiation using (4.47) \\nfor a few test cases in order to check the correctness of the implementation. \\n4.9 The Jacobian matrix \\nWe have seen how the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights \\ncan be obtained by the propagation of errors backwards through the network. \\nThe technique of back-propagation can also be applied to the calculation of', 'other derivatives. Here we consider the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, whose \\nelements are given by the derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the \\ninputs \\nwhere each such derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held fixed. Note \\nthat the term Jacobian matrix is also sometimes used to describe the derivatives 4-9: The Jacobian matrix 149 \\nof the error function with respect to the network weights, as calculated earlier \\nusing back-propagation. The Jacobian matrix provides a measure of the local \\nsensitivity of the outputs to changes in each of the input variables, and is useful \\nin several contexts in the application of neural networks. For instance, if there \\nare known errors associated with the input variables, then the Jacobian matrix \\nallows these to be propagated through the trained network in order to estimate \\ntheir contribution to the errors at the outputs. Thus, we have \\nIn general, the network mapping represented by a trained neural network will', 'be non-linear, and so the elements of the Jacobian matrix will not be constants \\nbut will depend on the particular input vector used. Thus (4.51) is valid only for \\nsmall perturbations of the inputs, and the Jacobian itself must be re-evaluated \\nfor each new input vector. \\nThe Jacobian matrix can be evaluated using a back-propagation procedure \\nwhich is very similar to the one derived earlier for evaluating the derivatives of \\nan error function with respect to the weights. We start by writing the element \\nJk% in the form \\nJ = ^Mh. = V^ dVk dai \\ndxi \" dai 8xi j \\nE« dyk \\n^ {452> \\nwhere we have made use of (4.26). The sum in (4.52) runs over all units j to \\nwhich the input unit i sends connections (for example, over all units in the first \\nhidden layer in the layered topology considered earlier). We now write down a \\nrecursive back-propagation formula to determine the derivatives dyk/daj \\ndyk _ y^ dyk dat \\nda,j ^-r* dai 9aj \\nB>t)Y,wvi!!r (4-53>', \"where the sum runs over all units I to which unit j sends connections. Again, we \\nhave made use of (4.26) and (4.27). This back-propagation starts at the output \\nunits for which, using (4.27), we have 150 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\n|^- = g'{ak)8kk, (4.54) \\nwhere 6kk' is the Kronecker delta symbol, and equals 1 if k = k' and 0 otherwise. \\nWe can therefore summarize the procedure for evaluating the Jacobian matrix \\nas follows. Apply the input vector corresponding to the point in input space at \\nwhich the Jacobian matrix is to be found, and forward propagate in the usual \\nway to obtain the activations of all of the hidden and output units in the network. \\nNext, for each row k of the Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the output unit k, \\nback-propagate using the recursive relation (4.53), starting with (4.54), for all of \\nthe hidden units in the network. Finally, use (4.52) to do the back-propagation \\nto the inputs. The second and third steps are then repeated for each value of k,\", 'corresponding to each row of the Jacobian matrix. \\nThe Jacobian can also be evaluated using an alternative forward propagation \\nformalism which can be derived in an analogous way to the back-propagation \\napproach given here (Exercise 4.6). Again, the implementation of such algorithms \\ncan be checked by using numerical differentiation in the form \\ndyk Vk(xi + e) - yk{xi - e) 2 \\ndxi 2e + 0(e2). (4.55) \\n4.10 The Hessian matrix \\nWe have shown how the technique of back-propagation can be used to obtain the \\nfirst derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights in the network. \\nBack-propagation can also be used to evaluate the second derivatives of the error, \\ngiven by \\n92E (4.56) dwudwik \\nThese derivatives form the elements of the Hessian matrix, which plays an im\\xad\\nportant role in many aspects of neural computing, including the following: \\n1. Several non-linear optimization algorithms used for training neural net\\xad', \"works are based on considerations of the second-order properties of the \\nerror surface, which are controlled by the Hessian matrix (Chapter 7). \\n2. The Hessian forms the basis of a fast procedure for re-training a feed\\xad\\nforward network following a small change in the training data (Bishop, \\n1991a). \\n3. The inverse of the Hessian has been used to identify the least signifi\\xad\\ncant weights in a network as part of network 'pruning' algorithms (Sec\\xad\\ntion 9.5.3). \\n4. The inverse of the Hessian can also be used to assign error bars to the \\npredictions made by a trained network (Section 10.2). Jt .10: The Hessian matrix 151 \\n5. Suitable values for regularization parameters can be determined from the \\neigenvalues of the Hessian (Section 10.4). \\n6. The determinant of the Hessian can be used to compare the relative prob\\xad\\nabilities of different network models (Section 10.6). \\nFor many of these applications, various approximation schemes have been\", 'used to evaluate the Hessian matrix. However, the Hessian can also be calculated \\nexactly using an extension of the back-propagation technique for evaluating the \\nfirst derivatives of the error function. \\nAn important consideration for many applications of the Hessian is the effi\\xad\\nciency with which it can be evaluated. If there are W parameters (weights and \\nbiases) in the network then the Hessian matrix has dimensions W x W and \\nso the computational effort needed to evaluate the Hessian must scale at least \\nlike 0(W2) for each pattern in the data set. As we shall see, there are efficient \\nmethods for evaluating the Hessian whose scaling is indeed 0(W2). \\n4.10.1 Diagonal approximation \\nSome of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the \\ninverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason there has \\nbeen some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, since its', 'inverse is trivial to evaluate. We again shall assume, as is generally the case, that \\nthe error function consists of a sum of terms, one for each pattern in the data \\nset, so that E = ]Tn En. The Hessian can then be obtained by considering one \\npattern at a time, and then summing the results over all patterns.

(1988) also used the diagonal approximation to the Hessian, \\nbut they retained all terms in the evaluation of d2En/dOj and so obtained exact \\nexpressions for the diagonal terms. Note that this no longer has 0(W) scaling. \\nThe major problem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice \\nthe Hessian is typically found to be strongly non-diagonal, and so these approxi\\xad\\nmations, which are driven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated \\nwith great care. \\n4.10.2 Outer product approximation \\nWhen neural networks are applied to regression problems, it is common to use \\na sum-of-squares error function of the form \\nE = \\\\Y,(yn-n2 (4-60) n \\nwhere we have considered the case of a single output in order to keep the notation', \"simple (the extension to several outputs is straightforward). We can then write \\nthe elements of the Hessian in the form \\ndwjidwik *-* duiji dwik *—i dwjidwik' \\nIf the network has been trained on the data set and its outputs yn happen to be \\nvery close to the target values tn then the second term in (4.61) will be small \\nand can be neglected. If the data are noisy, however, such a network mapping \\nis severely over-fitted to the data, and is not the kind of mapping we seek in \\norder to achieve good generalization (see Chapters 1 and 9). Instead we want to \\nfind a mapping which averages over the noise in the data. It turns out that for \\nsuch a solution we may still be able to neglect the second term in (4.61). This \\nfollows from the fact that the quantity (yn — tn) is a random variable with zero \\nmean, which is uncorrelated with the value of the second derivative term on the \\nright-hand side of (4.61). This whole term will therefore tend to average to zero\", \"in the summation over n (Hassibi and Stork, 1993). A more formal derivation of \\nthis result is given in Section 6.1.4. \\nBy neglecting the second term in (4.61) we arrive at the Levenberg-Marquardt \\napproximation (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, 1963) or outer product approxima\\xad\\ntion (since the Hessian matrix is built up from a sum of outer products of vectors), \\ngiven by \\na2£ =£££• (-) duijidwik z--' dwji dwik' \\nIts evaluation is straightforward as it only involves first derivatives of the error 4-10: The Hessian matrix 153 \\nfunction, which can be evaluated efficiently in 0(W) steps using standard back-\\npropagation. The elements of the matrix can then be found in G(W2) steps by \\nsimple multiplication. It is important to emphasize that this approximation is \\nonly likely to be valid for a network which has been trained correctly on the \\nsame data set used to evaluate the Hessian, or on one with the same statistical\", 'properties. For a general network mapping, the second derivative terms on the \\nright-hand side of (4.61) will typically not be negligible. \\n4.10.3 Inverse Hessian \\nHassibi and Stork (1993) have used the outer product approximation to develop a \\ncomputationally efficient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian. \\nWe first write the outer product approximation in matrix notation as \\nN \\nH* = X>\"(gn)T (4.63) \\nwhere N is the number of patterns in the data set, and the vector g = Vw£ \\nis the gradient of the error function. This leads to a sequential procedure for \\nbuilding up the Hessian, obtained by separating off the contribution from data \\npoint N + 1 to give \\nHN+1=Hw+g\"+1(g\"+1)T. (4.64) \\nIn order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian we now consider the matrix identity \\n(Kailath, 1980) \\n(A + BC)-1 = A\"1 - A-1B(I + CA-1B)-1CA~1 (4.65) \\nwhere I is the unit matrix. If we now identify HAT with A, gN+1 with B, and \\n(gJV+1)T with C, then we can apply (4.65) to (4.64) to obtain', 'r-i ...TT-i H^+\\'te^yrH^ \\nIJV+1 \"iV l + (gW+l)TH-V+1\" H^+1 = H^1 - :»*>* \\'». (4.66) \\nThis represents a procedure for evaluating the inverse of the Hessian using a \\nsingle pass through the data set. The initial matrix Ho is chosen to be al, where \\na is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually finds the inverse of H + al. \\nThe results are not particularly sensitive to the precise value of a. Extension \\nof this algorithm to networks having more than one output is straightforward \\n(Exercise 4.9). \\nWe note here that the Hessian matrix can sometimes be calculated indi\\xad\\nrectly as part of the network training algorithm. In particular, quasi-Newton \\nnon-linear optimization algorithms gradually build up an approximation to the \\ninverse of the Hessian during training. Such algorithms are discussed in detail in 154 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nSection 7.10. \\n4.10.4 Finite differences \\nAs with first derivatives of the error function, we can find the second derivatives', 'by using finite differences, with accuracy limited by the numerical precision of \\nour computer. If we perturb each possible pair of weights in turn, we obtain \\ng^Tk = 4? &{*» + e, wlk + e)~ E(Wji + e, wlk - e) \\n-E(wn - e, wik + e) + E{Wji - e, wik - e)} + C(e2). (4.67) \\nAgain, by using a symmetrical central differences formulation, we ensure that \\nthe residual errors are 0(e2) rather than 0(e). Since there are W2 elements \\nin the Hessian matrix, and since the evaluation of each element requires four \\nforward propagations each needing 0(W) operations (per pattern), we see that \\nthis approach will require 0(W3) operations to evaluate the complete Hessian. \\nIt therefore has very poor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful \\nas a check on the software implementation of back-propagation methods. \\nA more efficient version of numerical differentiation can be found by apply\\xad\\ning central differences to the first derivatives of the error function, which are', 'themselves calculated using back-propagation. This gives \\nM^(U\"fc + e)-^(t0,*-e)}+O(e9)- (468) d2E \\nSince there are now only W weights to be perturbed, and since the gradients \\ncan be evaluated in 0(W) steps, we see that this method gives the Hessian in \\n0(W2) operations. \\n4.10.5 Exact evaluation of the Hessian \\nSo far we have considered various approximation schemes for evaluating the Hes\\xad\\nsian matrix. We now describe an algorithm for evaluating the Hessian exactly, \\nwhich is valid for a network of arbitrary feed-forward topology, of the kind il\\xad\\nlustrated schematically in Figure 4.3 (Bishop, 1991a, 1992). The algorithm is \\nbased on an extension of the technique of back-propagation used to evaluate \\nfirst derivatives, and shares many of its desirable features including computa\\xad\\ntional efficiency. It can be applied to any differentiable error function which can \\nbe expressed as a function of the network outputs, and to networks having ar\\xad', 'bitrary differentiable activation functions. The number of computational steps \\nneeded to evaluate the Hessian scales like 0(W2). Similar algorithms have also \\nbeen considered by Buntine and Weigend (1993). As before, we shall consider \\none pattern at a time. The complete Hessian is then obtained by summing over \\nall patterns. 4.10: The. Hessian matrix 155 \\nConsider the general expression (4.33) for the derivative of the error function \\nwith respect to an arbitrary weight wjjt, which we reproduce here for convenience \\ndEn \\ndwtk = S(Zk-\\nDifferentiating this with respect to some other weight Wj, we obtain \\nQ2En da,j 8 \\ndwjidwik dwji da, \\\\dwik 8En \\nZi d (8En \\nddj \\\\dwik (4.69) \\n(4.70) \\nwhere we have used (4.26). Here we have assumed that the weight Wj, does not \\noccur on any forward propagation path connecting unit I to the outputs of the \\nnetwork. We shall return to this point shortly. \\nMaking use of (4.69), together with the relation Zk = g(ak), we can write \\n(4.70) in the form \\nQ2Bn', \"dwjidwik \\nwhere we have defined the quantities Zi8ig'(ak)hkj + z%Zkt \\nhkj — \\nbn — dak \\nda. \\ndSi (4.71) \\n(4.72) \\n(4.73) \\nThe quantities {hkj} can be evaluated by forward propagation as follows. \\nUsing the chain rule for partial derivatives we have \\n<-kj \\n= £ dak &ar \\ndar daj (4.74) \\nwhere the sum runs over all units r which send connections to unit k. In fact, \\ncontributions only arise from units which lie on paths connecting unit j to unit \\nk. From (4.26) and (4.27) we then obtain the forward propagation equation \\nhkj - Y^9'(ar)wkrhr (4.75) \\nThe initial conditions for evaluating the {hkj} follow from the definition (4.72), \\nand can be stated as follows. For each unit j in the network, (except for input \\nunits, for which the corresponding {hkj} are not required), set hjj = 1 and set 156 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nhkj = 0 for all units k ^ j which do not lie on any forward propagation path \\nstarting from unit j. The remaining elements of hkj can then be found by forward\", 'propagation using (4.75). \\nSimilarly, we can derive a back-propagation equation which allows the {bij} \\nto be evaluated. We have already seen that the quantities Si can be found by \\nback-propagation \\n<5<=</(ai)X>3\\'5*- (4-76) \\nSubstituting this into the definition of b\\\\j in (4.73) we obtain \\nwhich gives \\nhi = g\"(ai)hij ^2 wsiSs + g\\'(a{) ]P waib3j (4.78) \\nwhere the sums run over all units s to which unit / sends connections. Note that, \\nin a software implementation, the first summation in (4.78) will already have \\nbeen computed in evaluating the {61} in (4.76). \\nThere is one subtlety which needs to be considered. The derivative d/daj \\nwhich appears in (4.77) arose from the derivative djdw^ in (4.70). This transfor\\xad\\nmation, from Wji to a,j, is valid provided Wji does not appear explicitly within the \\nbrackets on the right-hand side of (4.77). In other words, the weight Wji should \\nnot lie on any of the forward-propagation paths from unit I to the outputs of the', \"network, since these are also the paths used to evaluate 61 by back-propagation. \\nIn practice the problem is easily avoided as follows. If Wji does occur in the \\nsequence of back-propagations needed to evaluate <5j, then we simply consider \\ninstead the diagonally opposite element of the Hessian matrix for which this \\nproblem will not arise (since the network has a feed-forward topology). We then \\nmake use of the fact that the Hessian is a symmetric matrix. \\nThe initial conditions for the back-propagation in (4.78) follow from (4.72) \\nand (4.73), together with the initial conditions (4.34) for the 6's, to give \\nbkj = YJHkk-hvj (4.79) \\nfc' \\nwhere we have defined \\nd2En 4.10: The Hessian matrix 157 \\nThis algorithm represents a straightforward extension of the usual forward \\nand backward propagation procedures used to find the first derivatives of the \\nerror function. We can summarize the algorithm in five steps:\", '1. Evaluate the activations of all of the hidden and output units, for a given \\ninput pattern, by using the usual forward propagation equations. Similarly, \\ncompute the initial conditions for the hkj and forward propagate through \\nthe network using (4.75) to find the remaining non-zero elements of hkj. \\n2. Evaluate 6k for the output units in the usual way. Similarly, evaluate the \\nJEffc for all the output units using (4.80). \\n3. Use the standard back-propagation equations to find 6j for all hidden units \\nin the network. Similarly, back-propagate to find the {bij} by using (4.78) \\nwith initial conditions given by (4.79). \\n4. Evaluate the elements of the Hessian for this input pattern using (4.71). \\n5. Repeat the above steps for each pattern in the training set, and then sum \\nto obtain the full Hessian. \\nIn a practical implementation, we substitute appropriate expressions for the \\nerror function and the activation functions. For the sum-of-squares error function', 'and linear output units, for example, we have \\nh = Vk~tk, Hkk< = 6kk> (4.81) \\nwhere 6kk> is the Kronecker delta symbol. \\n4.10.6 Exact Hessian for two-layer network \\nAs an illustration of the above algorithm, we consider the specific case of a layered \\nnetwork having two layers of weights. We can then use the results obtained above \\nto write down explicit expressions for the elements of the Hessian matrix. We \\nshall use indices i and i\\' to denote inputs, indices j and j\\' to denoted units in the \\nhidden layer, and indices k and k\\' to denote outputs. Using the previous results, \\nthe Hessian matrix for this network can then be considered in three separate \\nblocks as follows. \\n1. Both weights in the second layer: \\nd2En \\n= ZjZj\\'Skk\\'Hkk- (4.82) dwkjdwk \\n2. Both weights in the first layer: \\nd2En \\ndwjidwj\\'j - = XiXi>g\"(a.ji)6jj> 2J wjyfifc \\n+ xixilg\\'{ajl)g\\'{aj) ^ wkrwkiHkk. (4.83) \\nfc 158 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\n3.

(4.84) \\nIf one or both of the weights is a bias term, then the corresponding expressions \\nare obtained simply by setting the appropriate activation(s) to 1. \\n4.10.7 Fast multiplication by the Hessian \\nIn some applications of the Hessian, the quantity of interest is not the Hessian \\nmatrix H itself, but the product of H with some vector v. We have seen that the \\nevaluation of the Hessian takes 0(W2) operations, and it also requires storage \\nwhich is 0(W2). The vector vTH which we wish to calculate itself only has \\nW elements, so instead of computing the Hessian as an intermediate step, we \\ncan instead try to find an efficient approach to evaluating vTH directly, which \\nrequires only 0(W) operations. \\nWe first note that \\nvTH = vTV(V£) (4.85) \\nwhere V denotes the gradient operator in weight space. We can then estimate \\nthe right-hand side of (4.85) using finite differences to give \\nVTV(VE) = Vg(w + ev)-VgCw) + 0{e) (4 g6)\", 'Thus, the quantity vTH can be found by forward propagating first with the \\noriginal weights, and then with the weights perturbed by the small vector ev. \\nThis procedure therefore takes 0(W) operations. It was used by Le Cun et al. \\n(1993) as part of a technique for on-line estimation of the learning rate parameter \\nin gradient descent. \\nNote that the residual error in (4.86) can again be reduced from 0(e) to \\nC(e2) by using central differences of the form \\nVTV(V£) = V^w + ev^-V^w-ev) + ^ (4 g?) \\nwhich again scales as 0(W). \\nThe problem with a finite-difference approach is one of numerical inaccu\\xad\\nracies. This can be resolved by adopting an analytic approach (M0ller, 1993a; \\nPearlmutter, 1994). Suppose we write down standard forward-propagation and \\nback-propagation equations for the evaluation of VE. We can then apply (4.85) \\nto these equations to give a set of forward-propagation and back-propagation \\nequations for the evaluation of vTH. This corresponds to acting on the original', 'forward-propagation and back-propagation equations with a differential operator 4.10: The Hessian matrix 159 \\nvTV. Pearlmutter (1994) used the notation fc{} to denote the operator vTV \\nand we shall follow this notation. The analysis is straightforward, and makes use \\nof the usual rules of differential calculus, together with the result \\nK{w} = v. (4.88) \\nThe technique is best illustrated with a simple example, and again we choose \\na two-layer network with linear output units and a sum-of-squares error function. \\nAs before, we consider the contribution to the error function from one pattern in \\nthe data set. The required vector is then obtained as usual by summing over the \\ncontributions from each of the patterns separately. For the two-layer network, \\nthe forward-propagation equations are given by \\naj = y^WjiXi (4.89) \\ni \\nZi = g{aj) (4.90) \\ni \\nWe now act on these equations using the 7l{-} operator to obtain a set of forward \\npropagation equations in the form \\n^{M = X)«^i (4-92)', 'K{*i} = ff>i)ftfo} (4-93) \\nK{Vk} = Y, wM*i) + Y, Vk*zi (4-94) \\n5 i \\nwhere Vji is the element of the vector v which corresponds to the weight Wji. \\nQuantities of the form TZ{ZJ}, 1Z{aj} and T^{yk} are to be regarded as new \\nvariables whose values are found using the above equations. \\nSince we are considering a sum-of-squares error function, we have the follow\\xad\\ning standard back-propagation expressions: \\n6k=yk- tfc (4.95) \\n5J =</(%) X>fcA- (4-96) \\nk \\ni 160 4: The Multi-layer Perceptron \\nAgain we act on these equations with the 7?.{} operator to obtain a set of back-\\npropagation equations in the form \\nK{6k] = MVk} (4.97) \\nK{sj} = 9\"{a,i)Tl{aj}\\'^2lWkj6k \\nk \\n+ 9\\'(aj)Y2vki6k \\nk \\n+ </(%) X>kjft{4}- (4.98) \\nk \\nFinally, we have the usual equations for the first derivatives of the error \\ndE \\ndwkj \\ndE \\ndwji = 6kzj (4.99) \\n6jXi (4.100) \\nand acting on these with the TZ{} operator we obtain expressions for the elements \\nof the vector vTH: \\nI dwkj J \\nf dE ~) \\nI dwji J K{6k}zj + 8kn{zj} (4.101)', 'XiH{6j}. (4.102) \\nThe implementation of this algorithm involves the introduction of additional \\nvariables H{a,j}, 71{ZJ} and 7£{6j} for the hidden units, and TZ{6k} and 7l{yk} \\nfor the output units. For each input pattern, the values of these quantities can \\nbe found using the above results, and the elements of vTH are then given by \\n(4.101) and (4.102). An elegant aspect of this technique is that the structure of \\nthe equations for evaluating vTH mirror closely those for standard forward and \\nbackward propagation, and so software implementation is straightforward. \\nIf desired, the technique can be used to evaluate the full Hessian matrix by \\nchoosing the vector v to be given successively by a series of unit vectors of the \\nform (0,0,..., 1,..., 0) each of which picks out one column of the Hessian. This \\nleads to a formalism which is analytically equivalent to the back-propagation \\nprocedure of Bishop (1992), as described in Section 4.10.5, though with some', \"loss of efficiency in a software implementation due to redundant calculations.

Here we consider the other major class of neural network model, \\nin which the activation of a hidden unit is determined by the distance between \\nthe input vector and a prototype vector. \\nAn interesting and important property of these radial basis function networks \\nis that they form a unifying link between a number of disparate concepts as we\", 'shall demonstrate in this chapter. In particular, we shall motivate the use of \\nradial basis functions from the point of view of function approximation, regu-\\nlarization, noisy interpolation, density estimation, optimal classification theory, \\nand potential functions. \\nOne consequence of this unifying viewpoint is that it motivates procedures \\nfor training radial basis function networks which can be substantially faster than \\nthe metliods used to train multi-layer perceptron networks. This follows from the \\ninterpretation which can be given to the internal representations formed by the \\nhidden units, and leads to a two-stage training procedure. In the first stage, the \\nparameters governing the basis functions (corresponding to hidden units) are \\ndetermined using relatively fast, unsupervised methods (i.e. methods which use \\nonly the input data and not the target data). The second stage of training then', 'involves the determination of the final-layer weights, which requires the solution \\nof a linear problem, and which is therefore also fast. \\n5.1 Exact interpolation \\nRadial basis function methods have their origins in techniques for performing \\nexact interpolation of a set of data points in a multi-dimensional space (Powell, \\n1987). The exact interpolation problem requires every input vector to be mapped \\nexactly onto the corresponding target vector, and forms a convenient starting \\npoint for our discussion of radial basis function networks. \\nConsider a mapping from a d-dimensional input space x to a one-dimensional \\ntarget space t. The data set consists of N input vectors x\", together with corre\\xad\\nsponding targets tn. The goal is to find a function h(x) such that \\nh(x.n)=tn, n = l,...,JV. (5.1) 5.1: Exact interpolation 165 \\nThe radial basis function approach (Powell, 1987) introduces a set of N basis \\nfunctions, one for each data point, which take the form <^>(||x — x\"||) where </>(•)', 'is some non-linear function whose form will be discussed shortly. Thus the nth \\nsuch function depends on the distance ||x — xn||, usually taken to be Euclidean, \\nbetween x and x\". The output of the mapping is then taken to be a linear \\ncombination of the basis functions \\n/>(x) = ][>^(||x-xl). (5.2) \\nn \\nWe recognize this as having the same form as the generalized linear discriminant \\nfunction considered in Section 3.3. The interpolation conditions (5.1) can then \\nbe written in matrix form as \\n*w = t (5.3) \\nwhere t = (<n), w = (wn), and the square matrix 4? has elements $„„\\' = \\n<^(||xn — xn ||). Provided the inverse matrix #-1 exists we can solve (5.3) to give \\nw = *_1t. (5.4) \\nIt has been shown (Micchelli, 1986) that, for a large class of functions <j>{-), the \\nmatrix 3? is indeed non-singular provided the data points are distinct. When the \\nweights in (5.2) are set to the values given by (5.4), the function h(x) represents', 'a continuous differentiate surface which passes exactly through each data point. \\nBoth theoretical and empirical studies (Powell, 1987) show that, in the con\\xad\\ntext of the exact interpolation problem, many properties of the interpolating \\nfunction are relatively insensitive to the precise form of the non-linear function \\n</>(•). Several forms of basis function have been considered, the most common \\nbeing the Gaussian \\n^(x)=exp(-~) (5.5) \\nwhere a is a parameter whose value controls the smoothness properties of the \\ninterpolating function. The Gaussian (5.5) is a localized basis function with the \\nproperty that tj> —> 0 as |a;| —> oo. Another choice of basis function with the same \\nproperty is the function \\nc/>(x) = (x2 + a2ya, a>0. (5.6) \\nIt is not, however, necessary for the functions to be localized, and other possible \\nchoices are the thin-plate spline function 166 5: Radial Basis Functions \\n(j>(x)=x2\\\\n(x), (5.7) \\nthe function \\n4>(x) = (a;2 + a2f, 0</?<l, (5.8)', \"which for /? = 1/2 is known as the multi-quadric function, the cubic \\n<l>(x) = x3, (5.9) \\nand the 'linear' function \\n<j>(x) = x (5.10) \\nwhich all have the property that <j> —> oo as x —> oo. Note that (5.10) linear in \\nx — ||x — xn || and so is still a non-linear function of the components of x. In one \\ndimension, it leads to a piecewise-linear interpolating function which represents \\nthe simplest form of exact interpolation. As we shall see, in the context of neural \\nnetwork mappings there are reasons for considering localized basis functions. We \\nshall focus most of our attention on Gaussian basis functions since, as well as \\nbeing localized, they have a number of useful analytical properties. The technique \\nof radial basis functions for exact interpolation is illustrated in Figure 5.1 for a \\nsimple one-input, one-output mapping. \\nThe generalization to several output variables is straightforward.

The solid curve shows the interpolating func\\xad\\ntion which results from using Gaussian basis functions of the form (5.5) with\", 'width parameter a = 0.067 which corresponds to roughly twice the spacing of \\nthe data points. Values for the second-layer weights were found using matrix \\ninversion techniques as discussed in the text. \\n5.2 Radial basis function networks \\nThe radial basis function mappings discussed so far provide an interpolating \\nfunction which passes exactly through every data point. As the example in Fig\\xad\\nure 5.1 illustrates, the exact interpolating function for noisy data is typically \\na highly oscillatory function. Such interpolating functions are generally unde\\xad\\nsirable. As discussed in Section 1.5.1, when there is noise present on the data, \\nthe interpolating function which gives the best generalization is one which is \\ntypically much smoother and which averages over the noise on the data. An ad\\xad\\nditional limitation of the exact interpolation procedure discussed above is that \\nthe number of basis functions is equal to the number of patterns in the data', 'set, and so for large data sets the mapping function can become very costly to \\nevaluate. \\nBy introducing a number of modifications to the exact interpolation proce\\xad\\ndure we obtain the radial basis function neural network model (Broomhead and \\nLowe, 1988; Moody and Darken, 1989). This provides a smooth interpolating \\nfunction in which the number of basis functions is determined by the complexity \\nof the mapping to be represented rather than by the size of the data set. The \\nmodifications which are required are as follows: \\n1. The number M of basis functions need not equal the number TV of data \\npoints, and is typically much less than N. \\n2. The centres of the basis functions are no longer constrained to be given by 168 5: Radial Basis Functions \\ninput data vectors. Instead, the determination of suitable centres becomes \\npart of the training process. \\n3. Instead of having a common width parameter a, each basis function is', 'given its own width aj whose value is also determined during training. \\n4. Bias parameters are included in the linear sum. They compensate for the \\ndifference between the average value over the data set of the basis function \\nactivations and the corresponding average value of the targets, as discussed \\nin Section 3.4.3. \\nWhen these changes are made to the exact interpolation formula (5.12), we \\narrive at the following form for the radial basis function neural network mapping \\nM \\nVk (x) = Yi wkj (pj(x)+wkQ. (5.14) \\nj=l \\nIf desired, the biases Wfco can be absorbed into the summation by including an \\nextra basis function <po whose activation is set to 1. For the case of Gaussian \\nbasis functions we have \\n4>j(x) = exp / ^f— I (5.15) \\nwhere x is the d-dimensional input vector with elements x,, and fij is the vector \\ndetermining the centre of basis function <j>j and has elements /ijj. Note that \\nthe Gaussian basis functions in (5.15) are not normalized, as was the case for', 'Gaussian density models in Chapter 2 for example, since any overall factors can \\nbe absorbed into the weights in (5.14) without loss of generality. This mapping \\nfunction can be represented as a neural network diagram as shown in Figure 5.2. \\nNote that more general topologies of radial basis function network (more than \\none hidden layer for instance) are not normally considered. \\nIn discussing the representational properties of multi-layer perceptron net\\xad\\nworks in Section 4.3.1, we appealed to intuition to suggest that a linear super\\xad\\nposition of localized functions, as in (5.14) and (5.15), is capable of universal \\napproximation. Hartman et al. (1990) give a formal proof of this property for \\nnetworks with Gaussian basis functions in which the widths of the Gaussians are \\ntreated as adjustable parameters. A more general result was obtained by Park \\nand Sandberg (1991) who show that, with only mild restrictions on the form of', 'the kernel functions, the universal approximation property still holds. Further \\ngeneralizations of this results are given in (Park and Sandberg, 1993). As with \\nthe corresponding proofs for multi-layer perceptron networks, these are existence \\nproofs which rely on the availability of an arbitrarily large number of hidden \\nunits, and they do not offer practical procedures for constructing the networks. \\nNevertheless, these theorems are crucial in providing a theoretical foundation on \\nwhich practical applications can be based with confidence. 5.2: Radial basis function networks 169 \\nbias \\n<t>0 <l>s y> outputs \\nyc \\nbasis \\nv functions \\n/ <t>* \\ninputs \\nFigure 5.2.

An approximation scheme has this \\nproperty if, in the set of approximating functions (i.e. the set of functions cor\\xad\\nresponding to all possible choices of the adjustable parameters) there is one \\nfunction which has minimum approximating error for any given function to be \\napproximated. They also showed that this property is not shared by multi-layer \\nperceptrons. \\nThe Gaussian radial basis functions considered above can be generalized to \\nallow for arbitrary covariance matrices Sj, as discussed for normal probability \\ndensity functions in Section 2.1.1. Thus we take the basis functions to have the \\nform \\n^(x) = exp |-i(x - Mj)T^71(x - nt) J . (5.16) \\nSince the covariance matrices 5^ are symmetric, this means that each basis func\\xad\", 'tion has d{d-\\\\-2>)/1 independent adjustable parameters (where d is the dimension\\xad\\nality of the input space), as compared with the (d + 1) independent parameters \\nfor the basis functions (5.15). In practice there is a trade-off to be considered \\nbetween using a smaller number of basis with many adjustable parameters and \\na larger number of less flexible functions. 170 5: Radial Basis Functions \\n5.3 Network training \\nA key aspect of radial basis function networks is the distinction between the \\nroles of the first and second layers of weights. As we shall see, the basis functions \\ncan be interpreted in a way which allows the first-layer weights (i.e. the param\\xad\\neters governing the basis functions) to be determined by unsupervised training \\ntechniques. This leads to the following two-stage training procedure for training \\nradial basis function networks. In the first stage the input data set {xn} alone \\nis used to determine the parameters of the basis functions (e.g. \\\\i, and <jj for', \"the spherical Gaussian basis functions considered above). The basis functions \\nare then kept fixed while the second-layer weights are found in the second phase \\nof training. Techniques for optimizing the basis functions are discussed at length \\nin Section 5.9. Here we shall assume that the basis function parameters have \\nalready been chosen, and we discuss the problem of optimizing the second-layer \\nweights. Note that, if there are fewer basis functions than data points, then in \\ngeneral it will no longer possible to find a set of weight values for which the \\nmapping function fits the data points exactly. \\nWe begin by considering the radial basis function network mapping in (5.14) \\nand we absorb the bias parameters into the weights to give \\nM \\nVk (x) = J2 W*J $i (X) (5 •17) \\n3=0 \\nwhere <j>o is an extra 'basis function' with activation value fixed at (f>o = 1- This \\ncan be written in matrix notation as \\ny(x) = Wtf> (5.18)\", \"where W = (Wkj) and <f> = (rf>j). Since the basis functions are considered fixed, \\nthe network is equivalent to a single-layer network of the kind considered in Sec\\xad\\ntion 3.3 in the context of classification problems, where it is termed a generalized \\nlinear discriminant. As discussed in earlier chapters, we can optimize the weights \\nby minimization of a suitable error function. It is particularly convenient, as we \\nshall see, to consider a sum-of-squares error function given by \\nn k \\nwhere ££ is the target value for output unit k when the network is presented with \\ninput vector xn. Since the error function is a quadratic function of the weights, \\nits minimum can be found in terms of the solution of a set of linear equations. \\nThis problem was discussed in detail in Section 3.4.3, from which we see that \\nthe weights are determined by the linear equations 5.4-' Regularization theory 171 \\n$T$WT = $TT (5.20) \\nwhere (T)nfc = t% and (3?)nj = ^-(x™). The formal solution for the weights is\", \"given by \\nWT = *tT (5.21) \\nwhere the notation $' denotes the pseudo-inverse of $ (Section 3.4.3). In prac\\xad\\ntice, the equations (5.20) are solved using singular value decomposition, to avoid \\nproblems due to possible ill-conditioning of the matrix $. Thus, we see that the \\nsecond-layer weights can be found by fast, linear matrix inversion techniques. \\nFor the most part we shall consider radial basis function networks in which the \\ndependence of the network function on the second-layer weights is linear, and in \\nwhich the error function is given by the sum-of-squares. It is possible to consider \\nthe use of non-linear activation functions applied to the output units, or other \\nchoices for the error function. However, the determination of the second-layer \\nweights is then no longer a linear problem, and hence a non-linear optimization of \\nthese weights is then required. As we have indicated, one of the major advantages\", 'of radial basis function networks is the possibility of avoiding the need for such \\nan optimization during network training. \\nAs a simple illustration of the use of radial basis function networks, we return \\nto the data set shown in Figure 5.1 and consider the mapping obtained by using \\na radial basis function network in which the number of basis functions is smaller \\nthan the number of data points, as shown in Figure 5.3 \\nThe width parameter a in Figure 5.3 was chosen to be roughly twice the \\naverage spacing between the basis functions. Techniques for setting the basis \\nfunction parameters, including <jj, are discussed in detail in Section 5.9. Here we \\nsimply note the effect of poor choices of a. Figure 5.4 shows the result of choosing \\ntoo small a value for a, while the effect of having a too large is illustrated in \\nFigure 5.5. \\n5.4 Regularization theory \\nAn alternative motivation for radial basis function expansions comes from the', 'theory of regularization (Poggio and Girosi, 1990a, 1990b). In Section 1.6 the \\ntechnique of regularization was introduced as a way of controlling the smoothness \\nproperties of a mapping function. It involves adding to the error function an extra \\nterm which is designed to penalize mappings which are not smooth. For simplicity \\nof notation we shall consider networks having a single output y, so that with a \\nsum-of-squares error, the total error function to be minimized becomes \\nE = \\\\ 5>(*\") - H2 + \\\\l \\\\Py? d* (5.22) 172 5: Radial Basis Functions \\n1.0 \\ny \\n0.5 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 0.5 1.0 \\nFigure 5.3.

This leads to a network function which is over-smoothed, and which \\nagain gives a poor representation of the underlying function which generated \\nthe data. \\nwhere P is some differential operator, and v is called a regularization parameter. \\nNetwork mapping functions y(x) which have large curvature will typically give', 'rise to large values of \\\\Py\\\\2 and hence to a large penalty in the total error \\nfunction. The value of v controls the relative importance of the regularization \\nterm, and hence the degree of smoothness of the function y{x). \\nWe can solve the regularized least-squares problem of (5.22) by using calculus \\nof variations (Appendix D) as follows. Setting the functional derivative of (5.22) \\nwith respect to y(x) to zero we obtain \\n£{y(x\") - tn}6(x - xn) + i/PPy(x) = 0 (5.23) \\nn \\nwhere P is the adjoint differential operator to P and S(x) is the Dirac delta \\nfunction. The equations (5.23) are the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding \\nto (5.22). A formal solution to these equations can be written down in terms of \\nthe Green\\'s functions of the operator PP, which are the functions G(x, x\\') which \\nsatisfy \\nPPG(K,X!) = 6(x - x\\'). (5.24) \\nIf the operator P is translationally and rotationally invariant, then the Green\\'s', 'functions depend only on the distance ||x — x\\'|), and hence they are radial func\\xad\\ntions. The formal solution to (5.23) can then be written as 174 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nl,(x) = 5>nG(||x-x\"||) (5.25) \\nn \\nwhich has the form of a linear expansion in radial basis functions. Substituting \\n(5.25) into (5.23) and using (5.24) we obtain \\n^{y(xn)-r}5(x-xn) + i/^T/;n5(x-xn) = 0 (5.26) \\nn n \\nIntegrating over a small region around xn shows that the coefficients v>n satisfy \\n2/(xn) - tn + vwn = 0. (5.27) \\nValues for the coefficients wn can be found by evaluating (5.25) at the values of \\nthe training data points xn and substituting into (5.27). This gives the values of \\nwn as the solutions of the linear equation \\n(G + i/I)w = t (5.28) \\nwhere (G)„n< = (?(||xn — xn||), (w)n = wn, (t)„ = tn and I denotes the unit \\nmatrix. \\nIf the operator P is chosen to have the particular form \\n\\\\Py\\\\\\'dx^^yj\\\\Dly(x)\\\\2dx (5.29) \\nwhere D2t = (V2)\\' and D2l+l = V(V2)\\', with V and V2 denoting the gradient', \"and Laplacian operators respectively, then the Green's functions are Gaussians \\nwith width parameters a (Exercise 5.3). \\nWe see that there is a very close similarity between this form of basis func\\xad\\ntion expansion, and the one discussed in the context of exact interpolation in \\nSection 5.1. Here the Greens functions G(|jx —xn|j) correspond to the basis func\\xad\\ntions </>(||x — xn||), and there is one such function centred on each data point in \\nthe training set. Also, we see that (5.28) reduces to the exact interpolation result \\n(5.3) when the regularization parameter v is zero. When the regularization pa\\xad\\nrameter is greater than zero, however, we no longer have an exact interpolating \\nfunction. The effect of the regularization term is to force a smoother network \\nmapping function, as illustrated in Figure 5.6. \\nIn practice, regularization can also be applied to radial basis function net\\xad\\nworks in which the basis functions are not constrained to be centred on the data\", \"points, and in which the number of basis functions need not equal the number \\nof data points. Also, regularization terms can be considered for which the basis \\nfunctions are not necessarily the Green's functions. Provided the regularization \\nterm is a quadratic function of the network mapping, the second-layer weights 5.4: Regularization theory 175 \\n1.0 \\ny \\n0.5 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 0.5 x 1.0 \\nFigure 5.6. This shows the same data set as in Figure 5.1, again with one basis \\nfunction centred on each data point, and a width parameter a = 0.067. In this \\ncase, however, a regularization term is used, with coefficient v = 40, leading \\nto a smoother mapping (shown by the solid curve) which no longer gives an \\nexact fit to the data, but which now gives a much better approximation to the \\nunderlying function which generated the data (shown by the dashed curve). \\ncan again be found by the solution of a set of linear equations which minimize a \\nsum-of-squares error. For example, the regularizer\", \"n k l x * ' \\npenalizes mappings which have large curvature (Bishop, 1991b). This regularizer \\nleads to second-layer weights which are found by solution of \\nMW = $TT (5.31) \\nwhere \\nn \\\\ i \\\\ l l \\nand $ = ((f)1-) as before. When v = 0 (5.31) reduces to the previous result (5.20). \\nThe inclusion of the regularization term adds little to the computational cost, \\nsince most of the time is spent in solving the coupled linear equations (5.31). (5.32) 176 5: Radial Basis Functions \\n5.5 Noisy interpolation theory \\nYet another viewpoint on the origin of radial basis function expansions comes \\nfrom the theory of interpolation of noisy data (Webb, 1994). Consider a mapping \\nfrom a single input variable a; to a single output variable y in which the target \\ndata is generated from a smooth noise-free function h(x) but in which the input \\ndata is corrupted by additive noise. The sum-of-squares error, in the limit of \\ninfinite data, takes the form \\nE=\\\\ JJ{y{x + 0- h(x)}2p(Op(x) df dx (5.33)\", 'where p(x) is the probability density function of the input data, and p(£) is the \\nprobability density function of the noise. Changing variables using z = x + £ we \\nhave \\nE = i f f{y(z) - h(x)}2p(z - x)p(x)dzdx. (5.34) \\nA formal expression for the minimum of the error can then be obtained using \\nvariational techniques (Appendix D) by setting the functional derivative of E \\nwith respect to y(z) to zero, to give \\n/ h(x)p(z — x)p(x) dx \\ny(z) = i—^ . (5.35) \\n/ p(z — x)p(x) dx \\nIf we consider the case of a finite number of data points {xn} drawn from \\nthe distribution p(x), we can approximate (5.35) by \\nwhich we recognize as being an expansion in radial basis functions, in which \\nh{xn) are the expansion coefficients, and the basis functions are given by \\n4>{x-xn)=J{x~Xn) .. (5.37) \\nSince the function h(x) is unknown, the coefficients h(xn) should be regarded \\nas parameters to be determined from the data. To do this we note that h(x) is', 'noise-free and so we have h(xn) — tn. Thus (5.36) becomes an expansion in basis \\nfunctions in which the coefficients are given by the target values. Note that this \\nform of basis function expansion differs from that introduced in (5.14) and (5.15) 5.6: Relation to kernel regression 177 \\nin that the basis functions are normalized (Moody and Darken, 1989). Strictly \\nspeaking, the normalization in (5.36) would require lateral connections between \\ndifferent hidden units in a network diagram.

This implies that the width of the basis functions should', 'be large in relation to the spacing of the data, which is a useful rule of thumb \\nwhen designing networks with good generalization properties. \\n5.6 Relation to kernel regression \\nFurther motivation for the use of radial basis functions for function approxima\\xad\\ntion comes from the theory of kernel regression (Scott, 1992). This is a technique \\nfor estimating regression functions from noisy data, based on the methods of \\nkernel density estimation discussed in Section 2.5.3. Consider a mapping from \\nan input vector x to an output vector y, and suppose we are given a set of train\\xad\\ning data {x™, t\"} where n = 1,..., N. A complete description of the statistical \\nproperties of the generator of the data is given by the probability density p(x, t) \\nin the joint input-target space. We can model this density by using a Parzen \\nkernel estimator constructed from the data set. If we consider Gaussian kernel \\nfunctions, this estimator takes the form \\nN • - \\' \" ^n||2 _ lit - t\"', 'N ^ (27T/l2)(<<+<:>/2 \"^ \\\\ 2/l2 2h2 P(*,t) = ^(27r/t2)(d+c)/2exp|-- (5.40) \\nwhere d and c are the dimensionalities of the input and output opaces respec\\xad\\ntively. This is illustrated schematically, for the case of one input variable and \\none output variable, in Figure 5.7. \\nAs we have already seen, the goal of learning is to find a smooth mapping \\nfrom x to y which captures the underlying systematic aspects of the data, with\\xad\\nout fitting the noise on the data. In Section 6.1.3 it is shown that, under many \\ncircumstances, the optimal mapping is given by forming the regression, or condi\\xad\\ntional average (t|x), of the target data, conditioned on the input variables. This 178 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nFigure 5.7. Schematic illustration of the use of a kernel estimator to model the \\njoint probability density in the input-output space. The dots show the data \\npoints, and the circles represent Gaussian kernel functions centred on the data', 'points, while the curve shows the regression function given by the conditional \\naverage of t as a function of x. \\ncan be expressed in terms of |he conditional density p(t|x), and hence in terms \\nof the joint density p(x, t), as follows: \\ny(x) = (t|x> \\n= jtp(t\\\\x)dt \\nJ \\n7 tp(x, t) dt \\n(5.41) \\np(x, t) dt \\nIf we now substitute our density estimate (5.40) into (5.41) we obtain the fol\\xad\\nlowing expression for the regression of the target data \\ny(*) = E^expj-llx-x\"!!2^2} \\n£nexP{-||x-x\"P/2fc2} \\' (5.42) \\nThis is known as the Nadaraya-Watson estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, \\n1964), and has been re-discovered relatively recently in the context of neural \\nnetworks (Specht, 1990; Schi0ler and Hartmann, 1992). We see that (5.42) has \\nthe form of a normalized expansion in Gaussian radial basis functions defined in \\nthe input space, and should be compared with the form (5.38) obtained earlier \\nfrom the perspective of additive noise on the input data. Each basis function is', \"centred on a data point, and the coefficients in the expansion are given by the \\ntarget values tn. Note that this construction provides values for the hidden-to- 5.7: Radial basis function networks for classification 179 \\noutput unit weights which are just given by the target data values. \\nThis approach can be extended by replacing the kernel estimator with an \\nadaptive mixture model, as discussed in Section 2.6. The parameters of the mix\\xad\\nture model can be found using, for instance, the EM (expectation-maximization) \\nalgorithm (Section 2.6.2). For a mixture of M spherical Gaussian functions, we \\ncan write the joint density in the form \\nFollowing the same line of argument as before, we arrive at the following expres\\xad\\nsion for the regression: \\n_ E,P0>,«pHx-,,,lla/2tf} \\nn>~ £,P(/)e*p{-||x-M3/2Aa} ^ ' \\nwhich can be viewed as a normalized radial basis function expansion in which \\nthe number of basis functions is typically much smaller than the number of data\", 'points, and in which the basis function centres are no longer constrained to \\ncoincide with the data points. This result can be extended to Gaussian functions \\nwith general covariance matrices (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994b). \\n5.7 Radial basis function networks for classification \\nA further key insight into the nature of the radial basis function network is ob\\xad\\ntained by considering the use of such networks for classification problems (Lowe, \\n1995). Suppose we have a data set which falls into three classes as shown in Fig\\xad\\nure 5.8. A multi-layer perceptron can separate the classes by using hidden units \\nwhich form hyperplanes in the input space, as indicated in Figure 5.8(a). An \\nalternative approach is to model the separate class distributions by local kernel \\nfunctions, as indicated in (b). This latter type of representation is related to the \\nradial basis function network. \\nSuppose we model the data in each class Ck using a single kernel function,', \"which we write as p(x|Cfc). In a classification problem our goal is to model the \\nposterior probabilities p(Cfc|x) for each of the classes. These probabilities can be \\nobtained through Bayes' theorem, using prior probabilities p(Ck), as follows: \\nm|x) = Pj^£m (5.45, \\np(x) \\n_ p(x\\\\Ck)P(Ck) (546) \\nDfc'PMCfcOmo' 180 5: Radial Basis Functions \\n(a) (b) \\nFigure 5.8. Schematic example of data points in two dimensions which fall into \\nthree distinct classes. One way to separate the classes is to use hyperplanes, \\nshown in (a), as used in a multi-layer perceptron. An alternative approach, \\nshown in (b), is to fit each class with a kernel function, which gives the type \\nof representation formed by a radial basis function network. \\nThis can be viewed as a simple form of basis function network with normalized \\nbasis functions given by \\nWx) = V- f^'Lr N (5-47) \\nand second-layer connections which consist of one weight from each hidden unit\", 'going to the corresponding output unit, with value p(Cjt)- The outputs of this \\nnetwork represent approximations to the posterior probabilities. \\nIn most applications a single kernel function will not give a particularly good \\nrepresentation of the class-conditional distributions p(x|Cfc). A better represen\\xad\\ntation could be obtained by using a separate mixture model to represent each of \\nthe conditional densities. However, a computationally more efficient approach, \\nand one which may help to reduce the number of adjustable parameters in the \\nmodel, is to use a common pool of M basis functions, labelled by an index j, to \\nrepresent all of the class-conditional densities. Thus, we write \\nM \\np(x|Cfc) = £p(x|j)P(j|Cfc). (5.48) \\nAn expression for the unconditional density p(x) can be found from (5.48) by \\nsumming over all classes \\np(x) = £>(x|Cfc)P(C*) (5.49) \\nk 5.7: Radial basis function networks for classification 181 \\nM \\n= *£p(x\\\\j)P(j) (5.50)', \"where we have defined priors for the basis functions given by \\nP(j)=:^rP(j\\\\Ck)P(Ck).

(5.57) \\nThus, the activations of the basis functions can be interpreted as the posterior \\nprobabilities of the presence of corresponding features in the input space, and \\nthe weights can similarly be interpreted as the posterior probabilities of class \\nmembership, given the presence of the features. The activations of the hidden\", 'units in a multi-layer perceptron (with logistic sigmoid activation functions) can \\nbe given a similar interpretation as posterior probabilities of the presence of \\nfeatures, as discussed in Section 6.7.1. \\nNote from (5.50) that the unconditional density of the input data is expressed 182 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nin terms of a mixture model, in which the component densities are given by \\nthe basis functions. This motivates the use of mixture density estimation as a \\nprocedure for finding the basis function parameters, as discussed in Section 5.9.4. \\nIt should be emphasized that the outputs of this network also have a precise \\ninterpretation as the posterior probabilities of class membership. The ability to \\ninterpret network outputs in this way is of central importance in the effective \\napplication of neural networks, and is discussed at length in Chapter 6. \\nFinally, for completeness, we point out that radial basis functions are also', 'closely related to the method of potential functions (Aizerman et al., 1964; Ni-\\nranjan et al., 1989). This is a way of finding a linear discriminant function from \\na training set of data points, based on an analogy with electrostatics. Imagine \\nwe place a unit of positive charge at each point in input space at which there is a \\ntraining vector from class C\\\\, and a unit of negative charge at each point where \\nthere is a training vector from class C2. These charges give rise to an electro\\xad\\nstatic potential field which can be treated as a discriminant function. The kernel \\nfunction which is used to compute the contribution to the potential from each \\ncharge need not be that of conventional electrostatics, but can be some other \\nfunction of the radial distance from the data point. \\n5.8 Comparison with the multi-layer perceptron \\nRadial basis function networks and multi-layer perceptrons play very similar roles', 'in that they both provide techniques for approximating arbitrary non-linear func\\xad\\ntional mappings between multidimensional spaces. In both cases the mappings \\nare expressed in terms of parametrized compositions of functions of single vari\\xad\\nables. The particular structures of the two networks are very different, however, \\nand so it is interesting to compare them in more detail. Some of the important \\ndifferences between the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks \\nare as follows: \\n1. The hidden unit representations of the multi-layer perceptron depend on \\nweighted linear summations of the inputs, transformed by monotonic acti\\xad\\nvation functions. Thus the activation of a hidden unit in a multi-layer per\\xad\\nceptron is constant on surfaces which consist of parallel (d— l)-dimensional \\nhyperplanes in (/-dimensional input space. By contrast, the hidden units \\nin a radial basis function network use distance to a prototype vector fol\\xad', 'lowed by transformation with a (usually) localized function. The activation \\nof a basis function is therefore constant on concentric (d — l)-dimensional \\nhyperspheres (or more generally on (d — l)-dimensional hyperellipsoids). \\n2. A multi-layer perceptron can be said to form a distributed representation in \\nthe space of activation values for the hidden units since, for a given input \\nvector, many hidden units will typically contribute to the determination \\nof the output value. During training, the functions represented by the hid\\xad\\nden units must be such that, when linearly combined by the final layer \\nof weights, they generate the correct outputs for a range of possible input \\nvalues. The interference and cross-coupling between the hidden units which 5.9: Basis function optimization 183 \\nthis requires results in the network training process being highly non-linear \\nwith problems of local minima, or nearly flat regions in the error function', 'arising from near cancellations in the effects of different weights. This can \\nlead to very slow convergence of the training procedure even with advanced \\noptimization strategies. By contrast, a radial basis function network with \\nlocalized basis functions forms a representation in the space of hidden units \\nwhich is local with respect to the input space because, for a given input \\nvector, typically only a few hidden units will have significant activations. \\n3. A multi-layer perceptron often has many layers of weights, and a com\\xad\\nplex pattern of connectivity, so that not all possible weights in any given \\nlayer are present. Also, a variety of different activation functions may be \\nused within the same network. A radial basis function network, however, \\ngenerally has a simple architecture consisting of two layers of weights, in \\nwhich the first layer contains the parameters of the basis functions, and \\nthe second layer forms linear combinations of the activations of the basis', 'functions to generate the outputs. \\n4. All of the parameters in a multi-layer perceptron are usually determined \\nat the same time as part of a single global training strategy involving \\nsupervised training. A radial basis function network, however, is typically \\ntrained in two stages, with the basis functions being determined first by \\nunsupervised techniques using the input data alone, and the second-layer \\nweights subsequently being found by fast linear supervised methods. \\n5.9 Basis function optimization \\nOne of the principal advantages of radial basis function neural networks, as \\ncompared with the multi-layer perceptron, is the possibility of choosing suitable \\nparameters for the hidden units without having to perform a full non-linear \\noptimization of the network. In this section we shall discuss several possible \\nstrategies for selecting the parameters of the basis functions. The problem of \\nselecting the appropriate number of basis functions, however, is discussed in the', 'context of model order selection and generalization in Chapter 9. \\nWe have motivated radial basis functions from the perspectives of function \\napproximation, regularization, noisy interpolation, kernel regression, and the es\\xad\\ntimation of posterior class probabilities for classification problems. All of these \\nviewpoints suggest that the basis function parameters should be chosen to form \\na representation of the probability density of the input data. This leads to an \\nunsupervised procedure for optimizing the basis function parameters which de\\xad\\npends only on the input data from the training set, and which ignores any target \\ninformation. The basis function centres fij can then be regarded as prototypes \\nof the input vectors. In this section we discuss a number of possible strategies \\nfor optimizing the basis functions which are motivated by these considerations. \\nThere are many potential applications for neural networks where unlabelled', 'input data is plentiful, but where labelled data is in short supply. For instance, \\nit may be easy to collect examples of raw input data for the network, but the 184 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nlabelling of the data with target variables may require the time of a human expert \\nwhich therefore limits the amount of data which can be labelled in a reasonable \\ntime. With such applications, the two-stage training process for a radial basis \\nfunction network can be particularly advantageous since the determination of \\nthe non-linear representation given by first layer of the network can be done \\nusing a large quantity of unlabelled data, leaving a relatively small number of \\nparameters in the second layer to be determined using the labelled data. At each \\nstage of the training process, we can ensure that the number of data points is \\nlarge compared with the number of parameters to be determined, as required for \\ngood generalization.', 'One of the major potential difficulties with radial basis function networks, \\nhowever, also stems from the localized nature of the hidden unit representation. \\nIt concerns the way in which such a network addresses the curse of dimensionality \\ndiscussed in Section 1.4. There we saw that the number of hypercubes which are \\nneeded to fill out a compact region of a d-dimensional space grows exponentially \\nwith d. When the data is confined to some lower-dimensional sub-space, d is \\nto be interpreted as the effective dimensionality of the sub-space, known as the \\nintrinsic dimensionality of the data. If the basis function centres are used to fill \\nout the sub-space then the number of basis function centres will be an exponential \\nfunction of d (Hartman et al., 1990). As well as increasing the computation time, \\na large number of basis functions leads to a requirement for large numbers of \\ntraining patterns in order to ensure that the network parameters are properly \\ndetermined.', 'The problem is particularly severe if there are input variables which have \\nsignificant variance but which play little role in determining the appropriate \\noutput variables. Such irrelevant inputs are not uncommon in practical applica\\xad\\ntions. When the basis function centres are chosen using the input data alone, \\nthere is no way to distinguish relevant from irrelevant inputs. This problem is \\nillustrated in Figure 5.9 where we see a variable y which is a non-linear function \\nof an input variable x\\\\. We wish to use radial basis function network network \\nto approximate this function. The basis functions are chosen to cover the region \\nof the X\\\\ axis where data is observed. Suppose that a second input variable X2 \\nis introduced which is uncorrelated with x\\\\. Then the number of basis functions \\nneeded to cover the required region of input space increases dramatically as in\\xad\\ndicated in Figure 5.10. If y is independent of x2 then these extra basis functions', 'have no useful role in determining the value of y. Simulations using artificial data \\n(Hartman et al, 1990), in which 19 out of 20 input variables consisted of noise \\nuncorrelated with the output, showed that a multi-layer perceptron could learn \\nto ignore the irrelevant inputs and obtain accurate results with a small number \\nof hidden units, while radial basis function networks showed large error which \\ndecreased only slowly as the number of hidden units was increased. \\nProblems arising from the curse of dimensionality may be much less severe if \\nbasis functions with full covariance matrices are used, as in (5.16), rather than \\nspherical basis functions of the form (5.15). However, the number of parameters \\nper basis function is then much greater. 5.9: Basis function optimization 185 \\ny(xt) \\n-^ >>>- -s^ >^>- Vfr \\nFigure 5.9. A schematic example of a function y(x\\\\) of an input variable x\\\\ \\nwhich has been modelled using a set of radial basis functions.', 'Figure 5.10. As in Figure 5.9, but in which an extra, irrelevant variable xi \\nhas been introduced. Note that the number of basis functions, whose locations \\nare determined using the input data alone, has increased dramatically, even \\nthough X2 carries no useful information for determining the output variable. \\nWe have provided compelling reasons for using unsupervised methods to de\\xad\\ntermine the first-layer parameters in a radial basis function network by modelling \\nthe density of input data. Such method have also proven to be very powerful in \\npractice. However, it should be emphasized that the optimal choice of basis func\\xad\\ntion parameters for density estimation need not be optimal for representing the \\nmapping to the output variables. Figure 5.11 shows a simple example of a prob\\xad\\nlem for which the use of density estimation to set the basis function parameters \\nclearly gives a sub-optimal solution. 186 5: Radial Basis Functions', 'Figure 5.11. A simple example to illustrate why the use of unsupervised meth\\xad\\nods based on density estimation to determine the basis function parameters \\nneed not be optimal for approximating the target function. Data in one di\\xad\\nmension (shown by the circles) is generated from a Gaussian distribution p{x) \\nshown by the dashed curve. Unsupervised training of one Gaussian basis func\\xad\\ntion would cause it to be centred at x = a, giving a good approximation to \\np(x). Target values for the input data are generated from a Gaussian function \\ncentred at b shown by the solid curve. The basis function centred at a can only \\ngive a very poor representation of h(x). By contrast, if the basis function were \\ncentred at b it could represent the function h(x) exactly. \\n5.9.1 Subsets of data points \\nOne simple procedure for selecting the basis function centres fii is to set them \\nequal to a random subset of the input vectors from the training set, as was', 'done for the example shown in Figure 5.3. Clearly this is not an optimal pro\\xad\\ncedure so far as density estimation is concerned, and may also lead to the use \\nof an unnecessarily large number of basis functions in order to achieve adequate \\nperformance on the training data. This method is often used, however, to pro\\xad\\nvide a set of starting values for many of the iterative adaptive procedures to be \\ndiscussed shortly. \\nAnother approach is to start with all data points as basis functions centres \\nand then selectively remove centres in such a way as to have minimum disruption \\non the performance of the system. Such an approach was introduced into the \\nif-nearest-neighbour classification scheme by Devijver and Kittler (1982) and \\napplied to radial basis function networks used for classification by Kraaijveld \\nand Duin (1991). A procedure for selecting a subset of the basis functions so as \\nto preserve the best estimator of the unconditional density is given in Fukunaga \\nand Hayes (1989).', 'These techniques only set the basis function centres, and the width param\\xad\\neters Uj must be chosen using some other procedure. One heuristic approach is \\nto choose all the ffj to be equal and to be given by some multiple of the average \\ndistance between the basis function centres. This ensures that the basis func- 5.9: Basis function optimization 187 \\ntions overlap to some degree and hence give a relatively smooth representation \\nof the distribution of training data. We might also recognize that the optimal \\nwidth may be different for basis functions in different regions of input space. For \\ninstance, the widths may be determined from the average distance of each basis \\nfunction to its L nearest neighbours, where L is typically small. Such ad hoc \\nprocedures for choosing the basis function parameters are very fast, and allow \\na radial basis function network to be set up very quickly, but are likely to be \\nsignificantly sub-optimal. \\n5.9.2 Orthogonal least squares', 'A more principled approach to selecting a sub-set of the data points as basis \\nfunction centres is based on the technique of orthogonal least squares. To motivate \\nthis approach consider the following procedure for selecting basis functions. We \\nstart by considering a network with just one basis function. For each data point \\nin turn we set the basis function centre to the input vector for that data point, \\nand then set the second-layer weights by pseudo-inverse techniques using the \\ncomplete training set of N data points. The basis function centre which gives rise \\nto the smallest residual error is retained. In subsequent steps of the algorithm, \\nthe number of basis functions is then increased incrementally. If at some point in \\nthe algorithm I of the data points have been selected as basis function centres, \\nthen N — I networks are trained in which each of the remaining N — I data points \\nin turn is selected as the centre for the additional basis function. The extra basis', 'function which gives the smallest value for the residual sum-of-squares error is \\nthen retained, and the algorithm proceeds to the next stage. \\nSuch an approach would be computationally intensive since at each step it \\nwould be necessary to obtain a complete pseudo-inverse solution for each possible \\nchoice of basis functions. A much more efficient procedure for achieving the same \\nresult is that of orthogonal least squares (Chen et al., 1989, 1991). In outline, the \\nalgorithm involves the sequential addition of new basis functions, each centred \\non one of the data points, as described above. This is done by constructing a \\nset of orthogonal vectors in the space S spanned by the vectors of hidden unit \\nactivations for each pattern in the training set (Section 3.4.2). It is then possible \\nto calculate directly which data point should be chosen as the next basis function \\ncentre in order to produce the greatest reduction in residual sum-of-squares error.', 'Values for the second-layer weights are also determined at the same time. If the \\nalgorithm is continued long enough then all data points will be selected, and the \\nresidual error will be zero. In order to achieve good generalization, the algorithm \\nmust be stopped before this occurs. This is the problem of model-order selection, \\nand is discussed at length in Chapters 9 and 10. \\n5.9.3 Clustering algorithms \\nAs an improvement on simply choosing a subset of the data points as the basis \\nfunction centres, we can use clustering techniques to find a set of centres which \\nmore accurately reflects the distribution of the data points. Moody and Darken \\n(1989) use the K-means clustering algorithm, in which the number K of centres 188 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nmust be decided in advance. The algorithm involves a simple re-estimation pro\\xad\\ncedure, as follows. Suppose there are N data points xn in total, and we wish \\nto find a set of K representative vectors fij where j = 1 if. The algorithm', 'seeks to partition the data points {xn} into K disjoint subsets Sj containing Nj \\ndata points, in such a way as to minimize the sum-of-squares clustering function \\ngiven by \\nJ = E£iixn-M2 (5-58) j = l n£Sj \\nwhere pij is the mean of the data points in set Sj and is given by \\nM, = ± £ x». (5.59) \\n3 neSj \\nThe batch version of if-means (Lloyd, 1982) begins by assigning the points at \\nrandom to K sets and then computing the mean vectors of the points in each set. \\nNext, each point is re-assigned to a new set according to which is the nearest \\nmean vector. The means of the sets are then recomputed. This procedure is \\nrepeated until there is no further change in the grouping of the data points. It \\ncan be shown (Linde et al., 1980) that at each such iteration the value of J will \\nnot increase. The calculation of the means can also be formulated as a stochastic \\non-line process (MacQueen, 1967; Moody and Darken, 1989). In this case, the', 'initial centres are randomly chosen from the data points, and as each data point \\nxn is presented, the nearest /x, is updated using \\nAfij = V(xn - »j) (5.60) \\nwhere r) is the learning rate parameter. Note that this is simply the Robbins-\\nMonro procedure (Section 2.4.1) for finding the root of a regression function given \\nby the derivative of J with respect to fij. Once the centres of the basis functions \\nhave been found in this way, the covariance matrices of the basis functions can \\nbe set to the covariances of the points assigned to the corresponding clusters. \\nAnother unsupervised technique which has been used for assigning basis func\\xad\\ntion centres is the Kohonen topographic feature map, also called a self-organizing \\nfeature map (Kohonen, 1982). This algorithm leads to placement of a set of pro\\xad\\ntotype vectors in input space, each of which corresponds to a point on a regular \\ngrid in a (usually two-dimensional) feature-map space. When the algorithm has', 'converged, prototype vectors corresponding to nearby points on the feature map \\ngrid have nearby locations in input space. This leads to a number of applications \\nfor this algorithm including the projection of data into a two-dimensional space \\nfor visualization purposes. However, the imposition of the topographic property, \\nparticularly if the data is not intrinsically two-dimensional (Section 8.6.1), may 5.9: Basis function optimization 189 \\nlead to suboptimal placement of vectors. \\n5.9.4 Gaussian mixture models \\nWe have already discussed a number of heuristic procedures for setting the basis \\nfunction parameters such that the basis functions approximate the distribution of \\nthe input data. A more principled approach, however, is to recognize that this is \\nessentially the mixture density estimation problem, which is discussed at length \\nin Section 2.6. The basis functions of the neural network can be regarded as the', 'components of a mixture density model, whose parameters are to be optimized \\nby maximum likelihood. We therefore model the density of the input data by a \\nmixture model of the form \\nM \\np(x) = ;£P(j)&(x) (5.61) \\n3 = 1 \\nwhere the parameters P(j) are the mixing coefficients, and <f>j(x) are the ba\\xad\\nsis functions of the network. Note that the mixing coefficients can be regarded \\nas prior probabilities for the data points to have been generated from the jth \\ncomponent of the mixture. The likelihood function is given by \\nC == ]\\\\v{xn) (5.62) \\nn \\nand is maximized both with respect to the mixing coefficients P(j), and with \\nrespect to the parameters of the basis functions. This maximization can be per\\xad\\nformed by computing the derivatives of C with respect to the parameters and us\\xad\\ning these derivatives in standard non-linear optimization algorithms (Chapter 7). \\nAlternatively, the parameters can be found by re-estimation procedures based', 'on the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm, described in Section 2.6.2. \\nOnce the mixture model has been optimized, the mixing coefficients P(j) \\ncan be discarded, and the basis functions then used in the radial basis function \\nnetwork in which the second-layer weights are found by supervised training. By \\nretaining the mixing coefficients, however, the density model p(x) in (5.61) can \\nbe used to assign error bars to the network outputs, based on the degree of \\nnovelty of the input vectors (Bishop, 1994b). \\nIt is interesting to note that the if-means algorithm can be seen as a par\\xad\\nticular limit of the EM optimization of a Gaussian mixture model. From Sec\\xad\\ntion 2.6.2, the EM update formula for a basis function centre is given by \\n,,new _ Ivn \"(J[X\")X\" \\n^ ~ E„.PCil*»\\') (563) \\nwhere P(j\\\\x) is the posterior probability of basis function j, and is given in terms \\nof the basis functions and the mixing coefficients, using Bayes\\' theorem, in the 190 5: Radial Basis Functions \\nform', 'Pm = ^MM (5.64) p(x) \\nwhere p(x) is given by (5.61). Suppose we consider spherical Gaussian basis \\nfunctions having a common width parameter a. Then the ratio of the posterior \\nprobabilities of two of the basis functions, for a particular data point xn, is given \\nby \\np(« _ exp Mi*\"-^\\' + ii»«-MtH m. (5.65) \\nP{k\\\\xn) r 2cr2 2cr2 J P(k) \\nIf we now take the limit a —* 0, we see that \\nHg-0 if ||x\"-^||2>||x\"-/xfc||a. (5.66) \\nThus, the probabilities for all of the kernels is zero except for the kernel whose \\ncentre vector \\\\ik is closest to xn. In this limit, therefore, the EM update formula \\n(5.63) reduces to the /C-means update formula (5.59). \\n5.10 Supervised training \\nAs we have already remarked, the use of unsupervised techniques to determine \\nthe basis function parameters is not in general an optimal procedure so far as \\nthe subsequent supervised training is concerned. The difficulty arises because \\nthe setting up of the basis functions using density estimation on the input data', 'takes no account of the target labels associated with that data. In order to set \\nthe parameters of the basis functions to give optimal performance in computing \\nthe required network outputs we should include the target data in the training \\nprocedure. That is, we should perform supervised, rather than unsupervised, \\ntraining. \\nThe basis function parameters for regression can be found by treating the ba\\xad\\nsis function centres and widths, along with the second-layer weights, as adaptive \\nparameters to be determined by minimization of an error function. For the case \\nof the sum-of-squares error (5.19), and spherical Gaussian basis functions (5.15), \\nwe obtain the following expressions for the derivatives of the error function with \\nrespect to the basis function parameters \\ndE ST^, , n, ,nX ( Vn-^\\\\?\\\\ ll*\"-*M|2,ee,, \\n^ = LLfo*(x )-*fc>w«exP 2jT—) a3 (5-67) \\n1 n k \\\\ J\\' / J Exercises 191 \\nwhere fiji denotes the ith component of/x^. These expressions for the derivatives', 'can then be used in conjunction with one of the standard optimization strategies \\ndiscussed in Chapter 7. \\nThe setting of the basis function parameters by supervised learning represents \\na non-linear optimization problem which will typically be computationally in\\xad\\ntensive and may be prone to finding local minima of the error function. However, \\nprovided the basis functions are reasonably well localized, any given input vector \\nwill only generate a significant activation in a small fraction of the basis func\\xad\\ntions, and so only these functions will be significantly updated in response to that \\ninput vector. Training procedures can therefore be speeded up significantly by \\nidentifying the relevant basis functions and thereby avoiding unnecessary compu\\xad\\ntation. Techniques for finding these units efficiently are described by Omohundro \\n(1987). Also, one of the unsupervised techniques described above can be used', \"to initialize the basis function parameters, after which they can be 'fine tuned' \\nusing supervised procedures. However, one of the drawbacks of supervised train\\xad\\ning of the basis functions is that there is no guarantee that they will remain \\nlocalized. Indeed, in numerical simulations it is found that a subset of the basis \\nfunctions may evolve to have very broad responses (Moody and Darken, 1989). \\nAlso, some of the main advantages of radial basis function networks, namely fast \\ntwo-stage training, and interpretability of the hidden unit representation, are \\nlost if supervised training is adopted. \\nExercises \\n5.1 (*) Consider a radial basis function network represented by (5.14) with \\nGaussian basis functions having full covariance matrices of the form (5.16). \\nDerive expressions for the elements of the Jacobian matrix given by \\ndyk >H = —• (5-69) \\n5.2 (**) Consider a radial basis function network with spherical Gaussian basis\", \"of the form (5.15), network outputs given by (5.17) and a sum-of-squares \\nerror function of the form (5.19).

Investigate the effect of using \\ndifferent values for the regularization coefficient A, and show that, if the \\nvalue of A is either too small or too large, then the resulting network \\nmapping gives a poor approximation to the function h(x) from which the \\ndata was generated. 6 \\nERROR FUNCTIONS \\nIn previous chapters we have made use of the sum-of-squares error function, \\nwhich was motivated primarily by analytical simplicity. There are many other \\npossible choices of error function which can also be considered, depending on \\nthe particular application. In this chapter we shall describe a variety of different \\nerror functions and discuss their relative merits. \\nFor regression problems we shall see that the basic goal is to model the con\\xad\\nditional distribution of the output variables, conditioned on the input variables. \\nThis motivates the use of a sum-of-squares error function, and several important', 'properties of this error function will be explored in some detail. \\nFor classification problems the goal is to model the posterior probabilities of \\nclass membership, again conditioned on the input variables. Although the sum-\\nof-squares error function can be used for classification (and can approximate \\nthe posterior probabilities) we shall see that there are other, more appropriate, \\nerror functions which can be considered. Generally speaking, Sections 6.1 to 6.4 \\nare concerned with error functions for regression problems, while the remaining \\nsections are concerned primarily with error functions for classification. \\nAs we have stressed several times, the central goal in network training is not \\nto memorize the training data, but rather to model the underlying generator of \\nthe data, so that the best possible predictions for the output vector t can be \\nmade when the trained network is subsequently presented with a new value for', 'the input vector x. The most general and complete description of the generator \\nof the data is in terms of the probability density p(x, t) in the joint input-target \\nspace. For associative prediction problems of the kind we are considering, it is \\nconvenient to decompose the joint probability density into the product of the \\nconditional density of the target data, conditioned on the input data, and the \\nunconditional density of input data, so that \\np(x,t)=p(t|x)p(x) (6.1) \\nwhere p(t|x) denotes the probability density of t given that x takes a particular \\nvalue, while p(x) represents the unconditional density of x and is given by \\np(x) = fp(t,x)dt. (6.2) 6,1: Sum-of-squares error 195 \\nThe density p(x) plays an important role in several aspects of neural networks, \\nincluding procedures for choosing the basis function parameters in a radial basis \\nfunction network (Section 5.9). However, for the purposes of making predictions', 'of t for new values of x, it is the conditional density p(t|x) which we need to \\nmodel. \\nMost of the error functions which will be considered in this chapter can be \\nmotivated from the principle of maximum likelihood (Section 2.2). For a set of \\ntraining data {xn,tn}, the likelihood can be written as \\nC = ]Jp(xn,tn) \\nn \\n= JJp(tn\\\\xn)p(xn) (6.3) \\nn \\nwhere we have assumed that each data point (x\",t\") is drawn independently \\nfrom the same distribution, and hence we can multiply the probabilities. Instead \\nof maximizing the likelihood, it is generally more convenient to minimize the \\nnegative logarithm of the likelihood. These are equivalent procedures, since the \\nnegative logarithm is a monotonic function. We therefore minimize \\nE=-ln£ = - £lnp(tn|xn) - ]Tmp(xn) (6.4) \\nn n \\nwhere E is called an error function. As we shall see, a feed-forward neural network \\ncan be regarded as a framework for modelling the conditional probability density', 'p(t|x). The second term in (6.4) does not depend on the network parameters, \\nand so represents an additive constant which can be dropped from the error \\nfunction. We therefore have \\n£ = -£>p(tn|x\"). (6.5) \\nn \\nNote that the error function takes the form of a sum over patterns of an error \\nterm for each pattern separately. This follows from the assumed independence of \\nthe data points under the given distribution. Different choices of error function \\narise from different assumptions about the form of the conditional distribution \\np(t|x). For interpolation problems, the targets t consist of continuous quantities \\nwhose values we are trying to predict, while for classification problems they \\nrepresent labels defining class membership or, more generally, estimates of the \\nprobabilities of class membership. \\n6.1 Sum-of-squares error \\nConsider the case of c target variables t% where k = 1,..., c, and suppose that', \"the distributions of the different target variables are independent, so that we can 196 6: Error Functions \\nwrite \\np(tix)=n^ix)- <6-6) k=l \\nWe shall further assume that the distribution of the target data is Gaussian. More \\nspecifically, we assume that the target variable tk is given by some deterministic \\nfunction of x with added Gaussian noise e, so that \\ntk=hk(x) + ek. (6.7) \\nWe now assume that the errors ek have a normal distribution with zero mean, \\nand standard a deviation a which does not depend on x or on k. Thus, the \\ndistribution of ek is given by \\nP(<*) = 7^m75«p (-§|») . <6'8) (27T(72)1/2 \\nWe now seek to model the functions hk(x) by a neural network with outputs \\n2A:(x; w) where w is the set of weight parameters governing the neural network \\nmapping. Using (6.7) and (6.8) we see that the probability distribution of target \\nvariables is given by \\n^* W = (2^5)175 ex? ( ^ ) (6-9) \\nwhere we have replaced the unknown function hk(x) by our model t/fc(x;w).\", 'Together with (6.6) and (6.5) this leads to the following expression for the error \\nfunction \\nE = ^EEfe(x»-«2+iVclnff + fln(24 (6.10) n=lfc=l \\nWe note that, for the purposes of error minimization, the second and third terms \\non the right-hand side of (6.10) are independent of the weights w and so can \\nbe omitted.

We shall return to this result \\nlater. \\nWe have derived the sum-of-squares error function from the principle of maxi\\xad\\nmum likelihood on the assumption of Gaussian distributed target data. Of course \\nthe use of a sum-of-squares error does not require the target data to have a Gaus\\xad\\nsian distribution. Later in this chapter we shall consider the least-squares solution \\nfor an example problem with a strongly non-Gaussian distribution. However, as \\nwe shall see, if we use a sum-of-squares error, then the results we obtain cannot \\ndistinguish between the true distribution and any other distribution having the \\nsame mean and variance. \\nNote that it is sometimes convenient to assess the performance of networks \\nusing a different error function from that used to train them. For instance, in \\nan interpolation problem the networks might be trained using a sum-of-squares \\nerror function of the form \\n£ = ^Eiiy(x\";w)-tnn2 (6-14) n', 'where the sum runs over all N patterns in the training set, whereas for network \\ntesting it would be more convenient to use a root-mean-square (RMS) error of \\nthe form \\n£RMS = Enlly(*\"-,W*)-t\"|j2 \\n£j|t\"-t||2 \\nwhere w* denotes the weight vector of the trained network, and the sums now \\nrun over the N\\' patterns in the test set.

The derivative \\nof the sum-of-squares error (6.11) with respect to Ofc can be written as \\n^- = E»\\'(°z)(»ir-*)?)• (6-i9) n \\nIf we choose the activation function for the output units to be linear, g(a) = a, \\nthen this derivative takes a particularly simple form \\n*£ = £(!*-*)• (6-M) \"• n \\nThis allows the minimization with respect to the weights {tujy} (with the weights \\nw held fixed) to be expressed as a linear optimization problem, which can be \\nsolved in closed form as discussed in Section 3.4.3. Here we shall follow a similar \\nanalysis, except that we shall find it convenient to make the bias parameters \\nexplicit and deal with them separately. \\nWe first write the network mapping in the form \\nM 6.1: Sum-of-squares error 199 \\nMinimizing the sum-of-squares error (6.11) with respect to the biases first, we \\nthen obtain', 'g^-0 = E E w«*\" +u>ko-t»A=0 (6.22) \\nwhich can be solved explicitly for the biases to give \\nM \\nWko = *fc - E Wki*i (6-23) \\ni=i \\nwhere we have defined the following average quantities: \\nn=l n—1 \\nThe result (6.23) shows that the role of the biases is to compensate for the \\ndifference between the averages (over the data set) of the target values, and the \\nweighted sums of the averages of the hidden unit outputs. \\nIf we back-substitute the expression (6.23) into the sum-of-squares error we \\nobtain \\nN c ( M \"J \\nwhere we have defined \\n**=**- **» z? = z?-*j. (6.26) \\nWe can now minimize this error with respect to the output weights wjy to give \\nIt is convenient at this point to introduce a matrix notation so that (T)nfc = ££, \\n(W)fcj = Wkj and (Z)nj- = zj1. We can then write (6.27) in the form \\nZTZWT - ZTT = 0 (6.28) 200 6: Error Functions \\nwhere ZT denotes the transpose of Z. We can write an explicit solution for the \\nweight matrix as \\nWT = Z*T = 0 (6.29)', 'where Z* is the pseudo-inverse of the matrix Z given by \\nZt = (ZTZ)-1ZT. (6.30) \\nHere we have assumed that the matrix (ZTZ) is non-singular. A more general \\ndiscussion of the properties of the pseudo-inverse can be found in Section 3.4.3. \\nFor a single-layer network, this represents the optimal solution for the weights, \\nwhich can therefore be calculated explicitly. In the present case, however, this \\nexpression for the weights depends on the activations of the hidden units which \\nthemselves depend on the weights w. Thus, as the weights w change during \\nlearning, so the optimal values for the weights {wkj} will also change. Never\\xad\\ntheless, it is still possible to exploit the linear nature of the partial optimization \\nwith respect to the output unit weights as part of an overall strategy for error \\nminimization, as discussed in Section 7.3. \\n6.1.2 Linear sum rules \\nThe use of a sum-of-squares error function to determine the weights in a network', 'with linear output units implies an interesting sum rule for the jietwork outputs \\n(Lowe and Webb, 1991). Suppose that the target patterns used to train the \\nnetwork satisfy an exact linear relation, so that for each pattern n we have \\nuTtn+«o = 0 (6.31) \\nwhere u and uo are constants. We now show that, if the final-layer weights \\nare determined by the optimal least-squares procedure outlined above, then the \\noutputs of the network will satisfy the same linear constraint for arbitrary input \\npatterns. \\nSumming over all patterns n in (6.31) we find that the average target vector \\nt satisfies the relation UQ = —uTt where the components of t are given by (6.24). \\nThus, the linear relation (6.31) can be written in the form \\nuTt\" = uTt. (6.32) \\nThe network outputs, given by (6.21), can be written in vector notation as \\ny = Wz + w0. (6.33) \\nSimilarly, the solution for the optimal biases given by (6.23) can be written as 6.1: Sum-of-squares error 201 \\nw0 = t - Wz. (6.34)', 'Now consider the scalar product of y with the vector u, for an arbitrary input \\npattern. Using the optimal weights given by (6.29), together with (6.33) and \\n(6.34), we have \\nuTy = uT(wo + Wz) \\n= uTt + uTTT(zt)T(z - z) (6.35) \\nwhere we have used the following property of matrix transposes (AB)T = BTAT. \\nProm (6.32), however, it follows that \\n(uTTT)n = uTt\" = uT(t\" - t) = 0 (6.36) \\nwhere we have used the linear constraint (6.32). Combining (6.35) and (6.36) we \\nobtain \\nuTy = uTt (6.37) \\nand so the network outputs exactly satisfy the same linear sum rule as the target \\ndata. We shall see an application of this result in the next section. More generally, \\nif a set of targets satisfies several linear constraints simultaneously, then so will \\nthe outputs of the network (Exercise 6.3). \\n6.1.3 Interpretation of network outputs \\nWe next derive an important result for the interpretation of the outputs of a net\\xad\\nwork trained by minimizing a sum-of-squares error function. In particular, we', 'will show that the outputs approximate the conditional averages of the target \\ndata. This is a central result which has several important consequences for prac\\xad\\ntical applications of neural networks. An understanding of its implications can \\nhelp to avoid some common mistakes, and lead to more effective use of network \\nnetwork techniques. \\nConsider the limit in which the size N of the training data set goes to infinity. \\nIn this limit we can replace the finite sum over patterns in the sum-of-squares \\nerror with an integral of the form \\nE = AI^OO m £ £ <«*<*\";w) - «}a <6-38) n=l k \\n= JH//{vfc(x;w)-*fc}2p(tk.x)<ttfcdx (6-39) 202 6: Error Functions \\nwhere we have introduced an extra factor of l/N into the definition of the sum-\\nof-squares error in order to make the limiting process meaningful. We now factor \\nthe joint distributions p(tk,x) into the product of the unconditional density \\nfunction for the input data p(x), and the target data density conditional on the', 'input vector p(tk\\\\x), as in (6.1), to give \\nE=\\\\Y1 11{yk(x;w)-tk}2p(tk\\\\x)p(x)dtkdx. (6.40) \\nNext we define the following conditional averages of the target data \\n(ifc|x) = J tkp{tk\\\\x) dtk (6.41) \\n(t\\\\\\\\x)= Jt2kp{tk\\\\x)dtk. (6.42) \\nWe now write the term in brackets in (6.40) in the form \\n{Vk - tk}2 = {yk - (tk\\\\x) + (tk\\\\x) - tk}2 (6.43) \\n= {Vk ~ (tk\\\\x)}2 + 2{yk - (tk\\\\x)}{{tk\\\\x) - tk} \\n+ {{tk\\\\x)-tk}2 (6.44) \\nNext we substitute (6.44) into (6.40) and make use of (6.41) and (6.42). The \\nsecond term on the right-hand side of (6.44) then vanishes as a consequence of \\nthe integration over tk. The sum-of-squares error can then be written in the form \\nE = \\\\ £ f^x>w) - <**lx»aP(x) dx \\n+ \\\\ E /{<^x> ~ <**l*>a}p(x) dx. (6.45) \\nWe now note that the second term in (6.45) is independent of the network \\nmapping function yk(x;w) and hence is independent of the network weights w. \\nFor the purposes of determining the network weights by error minimization, this', 'term can be neglected. Since the integrand in the first term in (6.45) is non-\\nnegative, the absolute minimum of the error function occurs when this first term \\nvanishes, which corresponds to the following result for the network mapping \\nyk(x;w*) = {tk\\\\x) (6.46) 6.1: Sum-of-squares error 203 \\nJW \\nFigure 6.1. A schematic illustration of the property (6.46) that the network \\nmapping which minimizes a sum-of-squares error function is given by the con\\xad\\nditional average of the target data. Here we consider a mapping from a single \\ninput variable x to a single target variable t. At any given value Xo of the input \\nvariable, the network output y(xo) is given by the average oft with respect to \\nthe distribution p(t\\\\xo) of the target variable, for that value of x. \\nwhere w* is the weight vector at the minimum of the error function. Equa\\xad\\ntion (6.46) is a key result and says that the network mapping is given by the', 'conditional average of the target data, in other words by the regression of tfc \\nconditioned on x. This result is illustrated schematically in Figure 6.1, and by a \\nsimple example in Figure 6.2. \\nBefore discussing the consequences of this important result we note that it is \\ndependent on three key assumptions. First, the data set must be sufficiently large \\nthat it approximates an infinite data set. Second, the network function j/fc(x; w) \\nmust be sufficiently general that there exists a choice of parameters which makes \\nthe first term in (6.45) sufficiently small. This second requirement implies that \\nthe number of adaptive weights (or equivalently the number of hidden units) \\nmust be sufficiently large. It is important that the two limits of large data set \\nand large number of weights must be approached in a coupled way in order to \\nachieve the desired result. This important issue is discussed in Section 9.1 in the', 'context of generalization and the trade-off between bias and variance. The third \\ncaveat is that the optimization of the network parameters is performed in such \\na way as to find the appropriate minimum of the cost function. Techniques for \\nparameter optimization in neural networks are discussed in Chapter 7. \\nNote that the derivation of the result (6.46) did not depend on the choice of \\nnetwork architecture, or even whether we were using a neural network at all. It \\nonly required that the representation for the non-linear mapping be sufficiently \\ngeneral. The importance of neural networks is that they provide a practical \\nframework for approximating arbitrary non-linear multivariate mappings, and \\ncan therefore in principle approximate the conditional average to arbitrary ac\\xad\\ncuracy. 204 6: Error Functions \\nFigure 6.2. A simple example of a network mapping which approximates the \\nconditional average of the target data (shown by the circles) generated from', 'the function t = x + 0.3sin(27rx)4-e where e is a random variable drawn from a \\nuniform distribution in the range (—0.1,0.1). The solid curve shows the result \\nof training a multi-layer perceptron network with five hidden units using a sum-\\nof-squares error function. The network approximates the conditional average \\nof the target data, which gives a good representation of the function from \\nwhich the data was generated. \\nWe can easily see why the minimum of a sum-of-squares error is given by the \\naverage value of the target data by considering the simple error function \\nE(y) = (y-a)2 + (y-b)2 (6.47) \\nwhere a and b are constants. Differentiation of E{y) with respect to y shows that \\nthe minimum occurs at \\ny™» = (a + 6)/2 (6.48) \\nIn other words, the minimum is given by the average of the target data. The \\nmore general property (6.46) is simply the extension of this result to conditional \\naverages. \\nWe can also derive (6.46) in a more direct way as follows. If we take the sum-', 'of-squares error in the form (6.39) and set the functional derivative (Appendix D) \\nof E with respect to yk (x) to zero we obtain 6.1: Sum-of-squares error 205 \\nJ-TT = I {Vk(x) - t*}p(**|x)p(x) dtk = 0. (6.49) \\nIf we make use of (6.41) we then obtain (6.46) directly. The use of a functional \\nderivative here is equivalent to the earlier assumption that the class of functions \\n!/fc(x) is very general. \\nFor many regression problems, the form of network mapping given by the \\nconditional average (6.46) can be regarded as optimal. If the data is generated \\nfrom a set of deterministic functions hk(x) with superimposed zero-mean noise \\nek then the target data is given by \\ntf = Mxn)+ejJ. (6.50) \\nThe network outputs, given by the conditional averages of the target data, then \\ntake the form \\ny*(x) = <t*|x) = (hk(x) + e*|x) = A*(x) (6.51) \\nsince (en) — 0. Thus the network has averaged over the noise on the data and', 'discovered the underlying deterministic function. Not all regression problems are \\nas simple as this, however, as we shall see later. \\nNote that the first integral in (6.45) is weighted by the unconditional density \\np(x). We therefore see that the network function 2/fc(x) pays a significant penalty \\nfor departing from the conditional average (tk\\\\x) in regions of input space where \\nthe density p(x) of input data is high. In regions where p(x) is small, there is \\nlittle penalty if the network output is a poor approximation to the conditional \\naverage. This forms the basis of a simple procedure for assigning error bars to \\nnetwork predictions, based on an estimate of the density p(x) (Bishop, 1994b). \\nIf we return to (6.45) we see that the second term can be written in the form \\ni^y\"a2(x)p(x)dx (6.52) \\nwhere a\\\\ (x) represents the variance of the target data, as a function of x, and \\nis given by \\na\\\\{x) = («g|x) - (ifc(x>2 (6.53) \\n= ((tk - (tfc|x))2|x) (6.54)', '= J{tk-(tk\\\\x}}2p(tk\\\\x)dtk. (6.55) \\nIf the network mapping function is given by the conditional average (6.46), so 206 6: Error Functions \\nthat the first term in (6.45) vanishes, then the residual error is given by (6.52). \\nThe value of the residual error is therefore be a measure of the average variance \\nof the target data. This is equivalent to the earlier result (6.13) obtained for a \\nfinite data set. It should be emphasized, however, that these are biased estimates \\nof the variance, as discussed in Section 2.2, and so they should be treated with \\ncare in practical applications. \\nWe originally derived the sum-of-squares error function from the principle \\nof maximum likelihood by assuming that the distribution of the target data \\ncould be described by a Gaussian function with an x-dependent mean, and a \\nsingle global variance parameter. As we noted earlier, the sum-of-squares error \\ndoes not require that the distribution of target variables be Gaussian. If a sum-', 'of-squares error is used, however, the quantities which can be determined are \\nthe x-dependent mean of the distribution (given by the outputs of the trained \\nnetwork) and a global averaged variance (given by the residual value of the \\nerror function at its minimum). Thus, the sum-of-squares error function cannot \\ndistinguish between the true distribution, and a Gaussian distribution having \\nthe same x-dependent mean and average variance. \\n6.1.4 Outer product approximation for the Hessian \\nIn Section 4.10.2 we discussed a particular approximation to the Hessian matrix \\n(the matrix of second derivatives of the error function with respect to the network \\nweights) for a sum-of-squares error function. This approximation is based on a \\nsum of outer products of first derivatives. Here we show that the approximation \\nis exact in the infinite data limit, provided we are at the global minimum of the \\nerror function. Consider the error function in the form (6.45). Taking the second', \"derivatives with respect to two weights wr and ws we obtain \\nd2E ^ / / dyk dyk \\ndwrdw, \\n+ £/{ij3^»-M*»}p(x)<l*. (6.56) \\nUsing the result (6.46) that the outputs j/fc(x) of the trained network represent \\nthe conditional averages of the target data, we see that the second term in (6.56) \\nvanishes. The Hessian is therefore given by an integral of terms involving only \\nthe products of first derivatives. For a finite data set, we can write this result in \\nthe form \\n&E _ 1 » gyngyn \\ndwrdws N ^ ^ dwr dw3' K ' ' 6.1: Sum-of-squares error 207 \\n6.1.5 Inverse problems \\nThe fact that a least-squares solution approximates the conditional average of \\nthe target data has an important consequence when neural networks are used \\nto solve inverse problems. Many potential applications of neural networks fall \\ninto this category. Examples include the analysis of spectral data, tomographic \\nreconstruction, control of industrial plant, and robot kinematics. For such prob\\xad\", 'lems there exists a well-defined forward problem which is characterized by a \\nfunctional (i.e. single-valued) mapping. Often this corresponds to causality in a \\nphysical system. In the case of spectral reconstruction, for example, the forward \\nproblem corresponds to the evaluation of the spectrum when the parameters \\n(locations, widths and amplitudes) of the spectral lines are prescribed. In prac\\xad\\ntical applications we generally have to solve the corresponding inverse problem \\nin which the roles of input and output variables are interchanged. In the case \\nof spectral analysis, this corresponds to the determination of the spectral line \\nparameters from an observed spectrum. For inverse problems, the mapping can \\nbe often be multi-valued, with values of the inputs for which there are several \\nvalid values for the outputs. For example, there may be several choices for the \\nspectral line parameters which give rise to the same observed spectrum. If a', 'least-squares approach is applied to an inverse problem, it will approximate the \\nconditional average of the target data, and this will frequently lead to extremely \\npoor performance, (since the average of several solutions is not necessarily itself \\na solution). \\nAs a simple illustration of this problem, consider the data set shown earlier \\nin Figure 6.2 where we saw how a network which approximates the conditional \\naverage of the target data gives a good representation of the underlying gen\\xad\\nerator of the data. Suppose we now reverse the roles of the input and target, \\nvariables. Figure 6.3 shows the result of training a network of the same type as \\nbefore on the same data set, but with input and output variables interchanged. \\nThe network again tries to approximate the conditional average of the target \\ndata, but this time the conditional average gives a very poor description of the \\ngenerator of the data. The problem can be traced to the intermediate values of', 'x in Figure 6.3 where the target data is multi-valued. Predictions made by the \\ntrained network in this region can be very poor. The problem cannot be solved \\nby modifying the network architecture or the training algorithm, since it is a \\nfundamental consequence of using a sum-of-squares error function. For problems \\ninvolving many input and output variables, where visualization of the data is not \\nstraightforward, it can be very difficult to ascertain whether there are regions \\nof input space for which the target data is multi-valued. One approach to such \\nproblems is to go beyond the Gaussian description of the distribution of target \\nvariables, and to find a more general model for the conditional density, as will \\nbe discussed in Section 6.4. 208 6: Error Functions \\nFigure 6.3. An illustration of the problem which can arise when a least-squares \\napproach is applied to an inverse problem. This shows the same data set as', 'in Figure 6.2 but with the roles of input and output variables interchanged. \\nThe solid curve shows the result of training the same neural network as in \\nFigure 6.2, again using a sum-of-squares error. This time the network gives a \\nvery poor fit to the data, as it again tries to represent the conditional average \\nof the target values. \\n6.2 Minkowski error \\nWe have derived the sum-of-squares error function from the principle of maxi\\xad\\nmum likelihood on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of target data. We \\ncan obtain more general error functions by considering a generalization of the \\nGaussian distribution of the form \\nP(e) 2F{l/R) exp(-/3|e|fl) (6.58) \\nwhere T(o) is the gamma function (defined on page 28), the parameter ft con\\xad\\ntrols the variance of the distribution, and the pre-factor in (6.58) ensures that \\nJp(e) de = l. For the case of R = 2 this distribution reduces to a Gaussian. We \\nnow consider the negative log-likelihood of a data set, given by (6.5) and (6.6),', 'under the distribution (6.58). Omitting irrelevant constants, we obtain an error \\nfunction of the form \\n£ = ^2_>(xn;w)-t£ ntR (6.59) \\nn k=l 6.2: Minkowski eiror 209 \\n\\\\y-t\\\\ \\nFigure 6.4. Plot of the function \\\\y — t\\\\R against \\\\y — t\\\\ for various values of \\nR. This function forms the basis for the definition of the Minkowski-R error \\nmeasure. \\ncalled the Minkowski-R error. This reduces to the usual sum-of-squares error \\nwhen R = 2. For the case of R = 1, the distribution function (6.58) is a Laplacian, \\nand the corresponding Minkowski-R measure (6.59) is called the city block metric \\n(because the distance between two points on a plane measured by this metric is \\nequal to the Euclidean distance covered by moving between the two points along \\nsegments of lines parallel to the axes, as if moving along blocks in a city). More \\ngenerally, the distance metric \\\\y — t\\\\R is known as the LR norm. The function \\n\\\\y — t\\\\R is plotted against \\\\y — t\\\\ for various values of R in Figure 6.4.', 'The derivatives of the Minkowski-J? error function with respect to the weights \\nin the network are given by \\ndE \\ndwu Y, Yl l^(x\":w) - *EIK-1sign(l/fc(xB; w) - tnk) M dw (6.60) \\n\\'j» \\nThese derivatives can be evaluated using the standard back-propagation proce\\xad\\ndure, discussed in Section 4.8. Examples of the application of the Minkowski-R \\nerror to networks trained using back-propagation are given in Hanson and Burr \\n(1988) and Burrascano (1991). \\nOne of the potential difficulties of the standard sum-of-squares error is that it \\nreceives the largest contributions from the points which have the largest errors. \\nIf there are long tails on the distributions then the solution can be dominated \\nby a very small number of points called outliers which have particularly large \\nerrors. This is illustrated by a simple example in Figure 6.5. \\nA similarly severe problem can also arise from incorrectly labelled data. For', 'instance, one single data point for which the target value has been incorrectly \\nlabelled by a large amount can completely invalidate the least-squares solution. \\nf 6: Error Functions \\n(a) (b) \\nFigure 6.5.

The use of the Minkowski error with an R value less than 2 \\nreduces the sensitivity to outliers. For instance, with R — 1, the minimum error \\nsolution computes the conditional median of the data, rather than the condi\\xad', 'tional mean (Exercise 6.5). The reason for this can be seen by considering the \\nsimple error \\n£(i/) = £|y-tB|. \\nn \\nMinimizing E(y) with respect to y gives \\n]Tsign(2/-tn)=0 (6.61) \\n(6.62) \\nwhich is satisfied when y is the median of the points {£\"} (i.e. the value for which \\nthe same number of points tn have values greater than y as have values less than \\ny). If one of the tn is taken to some very large value, this has no effect on the \\nsolution for y. 6.3: Input-dependent variance 211 \\n6.3 Input-dependent variance \\nSo far we have assumed that the variance of the target data can be described \\nby a single global parameter a. In many practical applications, this will be a \\npoor assumption, and we now discuss more general models for the target data \\ndistribution. The sum-of-squares error is easily extended to allow each output to \\nbe described by its own variance parameter a^. More generally, we might wish to \\ndetermine how the variance of the data depends on the input vector x (Nix and', 'Weigend, 1994). This can be done by adopting a more general description for the \\nconditional distribution of the target data, and then writing down the negative \\nlog-likelihood in order to obtain a suitable error function. Thus, we write the \\nconditional distribution of the target variables in the form \\nForming the negative logarithm of the likelihood function as before, and omitting \\nadditive constants, we obtain \\nIf we now multiply by 1/N as before, and take the infinite-data limit, we obtain \\nthe error function in the form \\nE = J2JJ (ln^(x) + {VkiS(J)k}2) P^lxMx)^dx- (6-65) \\nThe functions er,t(x) can be modelled by adding further outputs to the neural \\nnetwork. We shall not consider this approach further, as it is a special case of \\na much more general technique for modelling the full conditional distribution, \\nwhich will be discussed shortly. \\nAn alternative approach to determining an input-dependent variance (Satch-', 'well, 1994) is based on the result (6.46) that the network mapping which mini\\xad\\nmizes a sum-of-squares error is given by the conditional expectation of the target \\ndata. First a network is trained in the usual way by minimizing a sum-of-squares \\nerror in which the t% form the targets. The outputs of this network, when pre\\xad\\nsented with the training data input vectors xn, correspond to the conditional \\naverages of the target data. These averages are subtracted from the target val\\xad\\nues and the results are then squared and used as targets for a second network \\nwhich is also trained using a sum-of-squares error function. The outputs of this \\nnetwork then represent the conditional averages of {tk — (tk\\\\x)}2 and thus ap\\xad\\nproximate the variances er|(x) given by (6.55). \\nThis procedure can be justified directly as follows. Consider the infinite data 212 6: Error Functions \\nlimit again, for which we can write the error function in the form (6.65). If we', \"again assume that the functions 2/jt(x) and o>(x) have unlimited flexibility then \\nwe can first minimize E with respect to the yk by functional differentiation to \\ngive \\nwhich, after some rearrangement, gives the standard result \\nyk(x) = (tk\\\\x) (6.67) \\nas before. We can similarly minimize E independently with respect to the func\\xad\\ntions o>(x) to give \\nr^fv = 0 = p(x) / ( * - (yt(x)-**>') rffc|x) dtk (6.68) \\n<W(x) J \\\\<Tk(x) 0-fc(x)3 ) \\nwhich is easily solved for ff|(x) to give \\n4(x) = {{tk - (t*|x»3|x) (6.69) \\nwhere we have used (6.67). We can then interpret (6.69) in terms of the two-stage \\ntwo-network approach described above. This technique is simple and can make \\nuse of standard neural network software. Its principal limitation is that it still \\nassumes a Gaussian form for the distribution function (since it makes use only \\nof the second-order statistics of the target data). \\nSince these approaches are based on maximum likelihood, they will give a\", 'biased estimate of the variances as discussed above, and so will tend to under\\xad\\nestimate the true variance. In extreme cases, such methods can discover patho\\xad\\nlogical solutions in which the variance goes to zero, corresponding to an infinite \\nlikelihood, as discussed in the context of unconditional density estimation in \\nSection 2.5.5. \\n6.4 Modelling conditional distributions \\nWe can view the basic goal in training a feed-forward neural network as that \\nof modelling the statistical properties of the generator of the data, expressed in \\nterms of a conditional distribution function p(t\\\\x). For the sum-of-squares error \\nfunction, this corresponds to modelling the conditional distribution of the target \\ndata in terms of a Gaussian distribution with a global variance parameter and an \\nx-dependent mean. However, if the data has a complex structure, as for example \\nin Figure 6.3, then this particular choice of distribution can lead to a very poor', \"representation of the data. We therefore seek a general framework for modelling \\nconditional probability distributions. 6.4'- Modelling conditional distributions 213 \\ninput \\nvector \\ni=> parameter \\nvector conditional \\nprobability \\ndensity \\nP(t|x) \\nneural \\nnetwork parametric \\ndistribution \\nFigure 6.6. We can represent general conditional probability densities p(t|x) \\nby considering a parametric model for the distribution of t whose parameters \\nare determined by the outputs of a neural network which takes x as its input \\nvector. \\nIn Chapter 2 we discussed a number of parametric techniques for modelling \\nunconditional distributions. Suppose we use one of these techniques to model the \\ndistribution p(t\\\\0) of target variables t, where 0 denotes the set of parameters \\nwhich govern the model distribution. If we allow the parameters 0 to be functions \\nof the input vector x, then we can model conditional distributions. We can\", 'achieve this by letting the components of 0(x) be given by the outputs of a \\nfeed-forward neural network which takes x as input. This leads to the combined \\ndensity model and neural network structure shown in Figure 6.6. Provided we \\nconsider a sufficiently general density model, and a sufficiently flexible network, \\nwe have a framework for approximating arbitrary conditional distributions. \\nFor different choices of the parametric model, we obtain different represen\\xad\\ntations for the conditional densities. For example, a single Gaussian model for \\np(t\\\\0) corresponds to the procedure described above in Section 6.3. Another pos\\xad\\nsibility is to use a linear combination of a fixed set of kernel functions. In this \\ncase the outputs of the network represent the coefficients in the linear combina\\xad\\ntion (Bishop and Legleye, 1995), and we must ensure that the coefficients are \\npositive and sum to one in order to preserve the positivity and normalization of', 'the conditional density. We do not discuss this approach further as it is a special \\ncase of the more general technique which we consider next. \\nA powerful, general framework for modelling unconditional distributions, \\nbased on the use of mixture models, was introduced in Section 2.6. Mixture \\nmodels represent a distribution in terms of a linear combination of adaptive ker\\xad\\nnel functions. If we apply this technique to the problem of modelling conditional \\ndistributions we have 214 6: Error Functions \\nM \\np(t|x) = ^Qj(x)^(t|x) (6.70) \\nj=i \\nwhere M is the number of components, or kernels, in the mixture. The parame\\xad\\nters Oj(x) are called mixing coefficients, and can be regarded as prior probabil\\xad\\nities (conditioned on x) of the target vector t having been generated from the \\njth component of the mixture. Note that the mixing coefficients are taken to be \\nfunctions of the input vector x. The function (j)j(t\\\\x) represents the conditional', 'density of the target vector t for the jth kernel. Various choices for the kernel \\nfunctions are possible. As in Chapter 2, however, we shall restrict attention to \\nkernel functions which are Gaussian of the form \\n^(t|x) = w^wexp(—^Tj (6-71) \\nwhere the vector fiAx) represents the centre of the jth kernel, with components \\nfijk, and c is the dimensionality oft. In (6.71) we have assumed that the compo\\xad\\nnents of the output vector are statistically independent within each of the kernel \\nfunctions, and can be described by a common variance <T?(X). This assumption \\ncan be relaxed in a straightforward way by introducing full covariance matrices \\nfor each Gaussian kernel, at the expense of a more complex formalism. In prin\\xad\\nciple, however, such a complication is not necessary, since a Gaussian mixture \\nmodel, with kernels given by (6.71), can approximate any given density function \\nto arbitrary accuracy, provided the mixing coefficients and the Gaussian parame\\xad', 'ters (means and variances) are correctly chosen (McLachlan and Basford, 1988). \\nThus, the representation given by (6.70) and (6.71) is completely general. In \\nparticular, it does not assume that the components of t are statistically inde\\xad\\npendent, in contrast to the single-Gaussian representation used in (6.6) and (6.9) \\nto derive the sum-of-squares error. \\nFor any given value of x, the mixture model (6.70) provides a general for\\xad\\nmalism for modelling an arbitrary conditional density function p(t|x). We now \\ntake the various parameters of the mixture model, namely the mixing coefficients \\nQj(x), the means (J.j(x) and the variances <T?(X), to be governed by the outputs \\nof a conventional neural network which takes x as its input. This technique was \\nintroduced in the form of the mixture-of-experts model (Jacobs et al., 1991) de\\xad\\nscribed in Section 9.7, and has since been discussed by other authors (Bishop,', '1994a; Liu, 1994; Neuneier et al, 1994). By choosing a mixture model with a suf\\xad\\nficient number of kernel functions, and a neural network with a sufficient number \\nof hidden units, this model can approximate as closely as desired any conditional \\ndensity function p(t|x). The original motivation for the mixture-of-experts model \\nwas to provide a mechanism for partitioning the solution to a problem between \\nseveral networks. This was achieved by using a separate network to determine \\nthe parameters of each kernel function, with a further network to determine the 6.4: Modelling conditional distributions 215 \\nmixing coefficients. For some applications this modular approach offers a number \\nof advantages, and is discussed further in Section 9.7. \\nThe neural network in Figure 6.6 can be any standard feed-forward network \\nstructure with universal approximation capabilities. Here we consider a multi\\xad\\nlayer perceptron, with a single hidden layer of sigmoidal units and an output', \"layer of linear units. For M components in the mixture model (6.70), the network \\nwill have M outputs denoted by z? which determine the mixing coefficients, M \\noutputs denoted by zj which determine the kernel widths Oj, and M x c outputs \\ndenoted by z^k which determine the components fijk of the kernel centres fij. \\nThe total number of network outputs is given by (c + 2) x M, as compared with \\nthe usual c outputs for a network used with a sum-of-squares error function. \\nIn order to ensure that the mixing coefficients otj(x) can be interpreted as \\nprobabilities, they must satisfy the constraints \\nM \\n£MX) = 1 (6-72) \\n3 = 1 \\n0 < aj(x) < 1. (6.73) \\nThe first constraint also ensures that the distribution is correctly normalized, \\nso that J p(t\\\\x)dt = 1. These constraints can be satisfied by choosing «j(x) to \\nbe related to the corresponding networks outputs by a softmax function (Bridle, \\n1990; Jacobs et al., 1991) \\nexp(zj) \\n°j = £Eiexp(*?)'\", 'We shall encounter the softmax function again in the next section when we \\ndiscuss error functions for classification problems. \\nThe variances Oj represent scale parameters and so it is convenient to repre\\xad\\nsent them in terms of the exponentials of the corresponding network outputs \\na, = exp(zj). (6.75) \\nIn a Bayesian framework (Exercise 10.13) this would correspond to the choice \\nof a non-informative prior, assuming the corresponding network outputs zj had \\nuniform probability distributions (Jacobs et al, 1991; Nowlan and Hinton, 1992). \\nThis representation also has the additional benefit of helping to avoid patholog\\xad\\nical configurations in which one or more of the variances goes to zero, since this \\nwould require the corresponding zj -+ —oo. The possibility of such results is \\ndiscussed in Section 2.6.1 in the context of mixture models for unconditional \\ndensity estimation. 216 6: Error Functions \\nThe centres (Xj represent location parameters, and again the notion of a non-', 'informative prior (Exercise 10.12) suggests that these be represented directly by \\nthe network outputs \\nHk = 4- (6.76) \\nAs before, we can construct an error function from the likelihood by using \\n(6.5) to give \\nn [j=l J \\nwith (f>j(t\\\\x) given by (6.71). The minimization of this error function with respect \\nto the parameters of the neural network leads to a model for the conditional den\\xad\\nsity of the target data. From this density function, any desired statistic involving \\nthe output variables can in principle be computed. \\nIn order to minimize the error function, we need to calculate the derivatives \\nof the error E with respect to the weights in the neural network. These can be \\nevaluated by using the standard back-propagation procedure, provided we obtain \\nsuitable expressions for the derivatives of the error with respect to the outputs \\nof the network. Since the error function (6.77) is composed of a sum of terms', 'E = Yin E\", one f°r eacn pattern, we can consider the derivatives <5£ = dEn/dzk \\nfor a particular pattern n and then find the derivatives of E by summing over \\nall patterns.

However, a number of applications involve angle-like \\noutput variables which live on a finite interval, usually (0,2JT) and which are in\\xad\\ntrinsically periodic. Due to the periodicity, the techniques described so far cannot \\nbe applied directly. Here we show how the general framework discussed above\", 'can be extended to estimate the conditional distribution p(0\\\\x) of a periodic \\nvariable 9, conditional on an input vector x (Bishop and Legleye, 1995). \\nThe approach is again based on a mixture of kernel functions , but in this case \\nthe kernel functions themselves are periodic, thereby ensuring that the overall \\ndensity function will be periodic. To motivate this approach, consider the prob\\xad\\nlem of modelling the distribution of a velocity vector v in two dimensions. Since \\nv lives in a Euclidean plane, we can model the density function p(v) using a \\nmixture of conventional spherical Gaussian kernels, where each kernel has the \\nform \\n*,«») = ^«P{-^-^} <*•«> \\nwhere (vx,vy) are the Cartesian components of v, and (fix,fiy) are the compo\\xad\\nnents of the centre /i of the kernel. From this we can extract the conditional 222 6: Error Functions \\ndistribution of the polar angle 9 of the vector v, given a value for t; = ||v||. This', 'is easily done with the transformation vx = vcos#, vy = usin#, and defining \\n0o to be the polar angle of fj,, so that fix = fi cos 0o and fiv = fisinffo, where \\n\\\\i = ||/LI||. This leads to a distribution which can be written in the form \\n#?) = ;r—V-rexp{mcos(0-0o)} <6-95) \\nwhere the normalization coefficient has been expressed in terms of the zeroth-\\norder modified Bessel function of the first kind, Io(m). The distribution (6.95) \\nis known as a circular normal or von Mises distribution (Mardia, 1972). The \\nparameter m (which depends on v in our derivation) is analogous to the (in\\xad\\nverse) variance parameter in a conventional normal distribution. Since (6.95) is \\nperiodic, we can construct a general representation for the conditional density \\nof a periodic variable by considering a mixture of circular normal kernels, with \\nparameters governed by the outputs of a neural network. The weights in the \\nnetwork can again be found by maximizing the likelihood function defined over', \"a set of training data. \\nAn example of the application of these techniques to the determination of \\nwind direction from satellite radar scatterometer data is given in Bishop and \\nLegleye (1995). This is an inverse problem in which the target data is multi\\xad\\nvalued. For problems involving periodic variables in which the target data is \\neffectively single-valued with respect to the input vector, then a single circular \\nnormal kernel can be used. \\nAn alternative approach to modelling conditional distributions of periodic \\nvariables is discussed in Exercise 6.8. \\n6.5 Estimating posterior probabilities \\nSo far in this chapter we have focused on 'regression' problems in which the \\ntarget variable are continuous. We now turn to a consideration of error functions \\nfor classification problems in which the target variables represent discrete class \\nlabels (or, more generally, the probabilities of class membership). \\nWhen we use a neural network to solve a classification problem, there are two\", 'distinct ways in which we can view the objectives of network training. At the sim\\xad\\npler level, we can arrange for the network to represent a non-linear discriminant \\nfunction so that, when a new input vector is presented to the trained network, \\nthe outputs provide a classification directly. The second approach, which is more \\ngeneral and more powerful, is to use the network to model the posterior proba\\xad\\nbilities of class membership. Typically there is one output unit for each possible \\nclass, and the activation of each output unit represents the corresponding pos\\xad\\nterior probability p(Cfc(x), where Ck is the kth class, and x is the input vector. \\nThese probabilities can then be used in a subsequent decision-making stage to \\narrive at a classification. \\nBy arranging for the network outputs to approximate posterior probabilities, \\nwe can exploit a number of results which are not available if the network is 6.5: Estimating posterior probabilities 223', 'used simply as a non-linear discriminant (Richard and Lippmann, 1991). These \\ninclude: \\nMinimum error-rate decisions \\nFrom the discussion of optimal classification in Section 1.9 we know that, to \\nminimize the probability of misclassification, a new input vector should be \\nassigned to the class having the largest posterior probability. Note that the \\nnetwork outputs need not be close to 0 or 1 if the class-conditional density \\nfunctions are overlapping. Heuristic procedures, such as applying extra \\ntraining using those patterns which fail to generate outputs close to the \\ntarget values, will be counterproductive, since this alters the distributions \\nand makes it less likely that the network will generate the correct Bayesian \\nprobabilities. \\nOutputs sum to 1 \\nSince the network outputs approximate posterior probabilities they should \\nsum to unity. This can be enforced explicitly as part of the choice of network \\nstructure as we shall see. Also, the average of each network output over', \"all patterns in the training set should approximate the corresponding prior \\nclass probabilities, since \\nP(Ck) = / P(Cfc|x)p(x) dx ~ 1 J2 P(Ck\\\\xn)- (6.96) \\nn \\nThese estimated priors can be compared with the sample estimates of the \\npriors obtained from the fractions of patterns in each class within the \\ntraining data set. Differences between these two estimates are an indication \\nthat the network is not modelling the posterior probabilities accurately \\n(Richard and Lippmann, 1991). \\nCompensating for different prior probabilities \\nIn some of the conventional approaches to pattern classification discussed \\nin Chapter 1, the posterior probabilities were expressed through Bayes' \\ntheorem in the form \\nm|x) = rfxKym) (6 97) \\np(x) \\nand the prior probabilities P(Ck) and class-conditional densities p(x\\\\Ck) \\nwere estimated separately. The neural network approach, by contrast, pro\\xad\\nvides direct estimates of the posterior probabilities. Sometimes the prior\", \"probabilities expected when the network is in use differ from those repre\\xad\\nsented by the training set. It is then it is a simple matter to use Bayes' \\ntheorem (6.97) to make the necessary corrections to the network outputs. \\nThis is achieved simply by dividing the network outputs by the prior prob\\xad\\nabilities corresponding to the training set, multiplying them by the new 224 6: Error Functions \\nprior probabilities, and then normalizing the results. Changes in the prior \\nprobabilities can therefore be accommodated without re-training the net\\xad\\nwork. The prior probabilities for the training set may be estimated simply \\nby evaluating the fraction of the training set data points in each class. \\nPrior probabilities corresponding to the network's operating environment \\ncan often be obtained very straightforwardly since only the class labels are \\nneeded and no input data is required. As an example, consider the prob\\xad\\nlem of classifying medical images into 'normal' and 'tumour'. When used\", \"for screening purposes, we would expect a very small prior probability of \\n'tumour'. To obtain a good variety of tumour images in the training set \\nwould therefore require huge numbers of training examples. An alternative \\nis to increase artificially the proportion of tumour images in the training \\nset, and then to compensate for the different priors on the test data as \\ndescribed above. The prior probabilities for tumours in the general popu\\xad\\nlation can be obtained from medical statistics, without having to collect the \\ncorresponding images. Correction of the network outputs is then a simple \\nmatter of multiplication and division. \\nCombining the outputs of several networks \\nRather than using a single network to solve a complete problem, there is \\noften benefit in breaking the problem down into smaller parts and treating \\neach part with a separate network. By dividing the network outputs by \\nthe prior probabilities used during training, the network outputs become\", 'likelihoods scaled by the unconditional density of the input vectors. These \\nscaled likelihoods can be multiplied together on the assumption that the \\ninput vectors for the various networks are independent. Since the scaling \\nfactor is independent of class, a classifier based on the product of scaled \\nlikelihoods will give the same results as one based on the true likelihoods. \\nThis approach has been successfully applied to problems in speech recog\\xad\\nnition (Bourlard and Morgan, 1990; Singer and Lippmann, 1992). \\nMinimum risk \\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the goal of a classification system may not \\nalways be to minimize the probability of misclassification. Different mis-\\nclassifications may carry different penalties, and we may wish to minimize \\nthe overall loss or risk (Section 1.10). Again the medical screening appli\\xad\\ncation provides a good example. It may be far more serious to mis-classify \\na tumour image as normal than to mis-classify a normal image as that of', 'a tumour. In this case, the posterior probabilities from the network can \\nbe combined with a suitable matrix of loss coefficients to allow the mini\\xad\\nmum risk decision to be made. Again, no network re-training is required to \\nachieve this. However, if the required loss matrix elements are known before \\nthe network is trained, then it may be better to modify the, error function \\nas will be discussed for the case of a sum-of-squares error in Section 6.6.2. 6.6: Sum-of-squares for classification 225 \\nRejection thresholds \\nIn Section 1.10.1 we introduced the concept of a rejection threshold, which \\nis such that if all of the posterior probabilities fall below this threshold then \\nno classification decision is made. Alternative classification techniques can \\nthen be applied to the rejected cases. This reflects the costs associated \\nwith making the wrong decisions balanced against the cost of alternative \\nclassification procedures. In the medical image classification problem, for', 'instance, it may be better not to try to classify doubtful images automati\\xad\\ncally, but instead to have a human expert provide a decision. Rejection of \\ninput vectors can be achieved in a principled way, provided the network \\noutputs represent posterior probabilities of class membership. \\nIn subsequent sections of this chapter we show how the outputs of a network can \\nbe interpreted as approximations to posterior probabilities, provided the error \\nfunction used for network training is carefully chosen. We also show that some \\nerror functions allow networks to represent non-linear discriminants, even though \\nthe output values themselves need not correspond to probabilities. \\n6.6 Sum-of-squares for classification \\nIn the previous section we showed that, for a network trained by minimizing a \\nsum-of-squares error function, the network outputs approximate the conditional \\naverages of the target data \\nVk(x) = (*fc|x> = ftkp(tk\\\\x)dtk. (6.98)', 'In the case of a classification problem, every input vector in the training set is \\nlabelled by its class membership, represented by a set of target values ££. The \\ntargets can be chosen according to a variety of schemes, but the most convenient \\nis the 1-of-c coding in which, for an input vector xn from class Ci, we have \\n^k ~ &M where fikt is the Kronecker delta symbol defined on page xiii. In this \\ncase the target values are precisely known and the density function in target \\nspace becomes singular and can be written as \\nc \\np(*fc|x) = J26(tk - Sk,)P(C,\\\\x) (6.99) \\nsince P(C[\\\\x) is the probability that x belongs to class C;. If we now substitute \\n(6.99) into (6.98) we obtain \\n»fc(x) = P(Cfc|x) (6.100) \\nso that the outputs of the network correspond to Bayesian posterior probabilities \\n(White, 1989; Richard and Lippmann, 1991). 226 6: Error Functions \\nIf the network outputs represent probabilities, then they should lie in the', 'range (0,1) and should sum to 1. For a network with linear output units, trained \\nby minimizing a sum-of-squares error function, it was shown in Section 6.1.2 \\nthat if the target values satisfy a linear constraint, then the network outputs will \\nsatisfy the same constraint for an arbitrary input vector. In the case of a 1-of-c \\ncoding scheme, the target values sum to unity for each pattern, and so the net\\xad\\nwork outputs will also always sum to unity. However, there is no guarantee that \\nthey will lie in the range (0,1). In fact, the sum-of-squares error function is not \\nthe most appropriate for classification problems. It was derived from maximum \\nlikelihood on the assumption of Gaussian distributed target data. However, the \\ntarget values for a 1-of-c coding scheme are binary, and hence far from having \\na Gaussian distribution. Later we discuss error measures which are more ap\\xad\\npropriate for classification problems. However, there are advantages in using a', 'sum-of-squares error, including the fact that the determination of the output \\nweights in a network represents a linear optimization problem. The significance \\nof this result for radial basis function networks was described in Chapter 5. We \\ntherefore discuss the use of a sum-of-squares error for classification problems in \\nmore detail before considering alternative choices of error function. \\nFor a two-class problem, the 1-of-c target coding scheme described above \\nleads to a network with two output units, one for each class, whose activations \\nrepresent the corresponding probabilities of class membership. An alternative \\napproach, however, is to use a single output y and a target coding which sets \\ntn = 1 if x™ is from class C\\\\ and tn = 0 if xn is from class Ci- In this case, the \\ndistribution of target values is given by \\np(tfc|x) = 6(t - l)P(Ci|x) + 6(t)P(C2\\\\x). (6.101) \\nSubstituting this into (6.98) gives \\ny(x) = P(C1\\\\x) (6.102)', 'and so the network output j/(x) represents the posterior probability of the input \\nvector x belonging to class C\\\\. The corresponding probability for class C2 is then \\ngiven by P(C2|x) = 1 - y(x). \\n6.6.1 Interpretation of hidden units \\nIn Section 6.1.1 we derived the expression (6.29) for the final-layer weights which \\nminimizes a sum-of-squares error, for networks with linear output units. By sub\\xad\\nstituting this result back into the error function we obtain an expression in which \\nthe only adaptive parameters are those associated with hidden units, which we \\ndenote by w. This expression sheds light on the nature of the hidden unit rep\\xad\\nresentation which a network learns, and indicates why multi-layer non-linear \\nneural networks can be effective as pattern classification systems (Webb and \\nLowe, 1990). 6.6: Sum-of-squares for classification 121 \\nWriting (6.25) in matrix notation we obtain \\nE = ^Tr{(ZWT - T)(ZWT - T)T} (6.103)', 'where Z, W and T are defined on page 199. We now substitute the solution \\n(6.29) for the optimal weights into (6.103) to give \\nE = ^TY{(ZztT - T)(ZZtT - T)T}. (6.104) \\nBy using some matrix manipulation (Exercise 6.9) we can write this in the form \\n£= ^{T^T-SBS^1} (6.105) \\nHere Sr is given by \\nSr = ZTZ = ^(zn - z)(z\" - z)T (6.106) \\nn \\nand the components of z are defined by (6.24). We see that this can be interpreted \\nas the total covariance matrix for the activations at the output of the final layer \\nof hidden units with respect to the training data set. Similarly, Sg in (6.105) is \\ngiven by \\nSB = ZTTTTZ (6.107) \\nwhich can be interpreted (as we shall see) as a form of between-class covariance \\nmatrix. \\nSince the first term in the curly brackets in (6.105) depends only on the \\ntarget data it is independent of the remaining weights w in the network. Thus, \\nminimizing the sum-of-squares error is equivalent to maximizing a particular', 'discriminant function defined with respect to the activations of the final-layer \\nhidden units given by \\nJ = iTr{SBS^}. (6.108) \\nNote that, if the matrix ST is ill-conditioned, then the inverse matrix S^.1 should \\nbe replaced by the pseudo-inverse ST. The criterion (6.108) has a clear similarity \\nto the Fisher discriminant function which is discussed in Section 3.6. Nothing \\nhere is specific to the multi-layer perceptron, or indeed to neural networks. The \\nsame result is obtained regardless of the functions Zj (x; w) and applies to any \\ngeneralized linear discriminant in which the basis functions contain adaptive 228 6: Eiror Functions \\nparameters. \\nThe role played by the hidden units can now be stated as follows. The weights \\nin the final layer are adjusted to produce an optimum discrimination of the \\nclasses of input vectors by means of a linear transformation. Minimizing the \\nerror of this linear discriminant requires that the input data undergo a non\\xad', 'linear transformation into the space spanned by the activations of the hidden \\nunits in such a way as to maximize the discriminant function given by (6.108). \\nFurther insight into the nature of the matrix SB is obtained by considering \\na particular target coding scheme. For the 1-of-c target coding scheme we can \\nwrite (6.107) in the form (Exercise 6.10) \\nSB = £ Nk&h - SK** - *)T (6-109) k \\nwhere Nk is the number of patterns in class Ck and zk is the mean activation \\nvector of the hidden units for all training patterns in class Ck, and is defined by \\n* = A £z\"- (6110) \\n* neck \\nNote that Si? in (6.109) differs from the conventional between-class covariance \\nmatrix introduced in Section 3.6 by having factors of N% instead of Nk in the sum \\nover classes. This represents a strong weighting of the feature extraction criterion \\nin favour of classes with larger numbers of patterns. If there is a significant \\ndifference between the prior probabilities for the training and test data sets,', \"then this effect may be undesirable, and we shall shortly see how to correct for it \\nby modifying the sum-of-squares error measure. As discussed in Section 3.6, there \\nare several ways to generalize Fisher's original two-class discriminant criterion to \\nseveral classes, all of which reduce to the original Fisher result as a special case. \\nIn general, there is no way to decide which of these will yield the best results. For \\na two-class problem, the between-class covariance matrix given in (6.109) differs \\nfrom the conventional one only by a multiplicative constant, so in this case the \\nnetwork criterion is equivalent to the original Fisher expression. \\nIn earlier work, Gallinari et al. (1988, 1991) showed that, for a network of \\nlinear processing units with a 1-of-c target coding, the minimization of a sum-of-\\nsquares error gave a set of input-to-hidden weights which maximized a criterion \\nwhich took the form of a ratio of determinants of between-class and total covari\\xad\", 'ance matrices defined at the outputs of the hidden units. The results of Webb \\nand Lowe (1990) contain this result as a special case. \\n6.6.2 Weighted sum-of-squares \\nWe have seen that, for networks with linear output units, minimization of a \\nsum-of-squares error at the network outputs maximizes a particular non-linear \\nfeature extraction criterion 6.6: Sum-of-squares for classification 229 \\nJ=-TI{SBST1} (6.111) \\nat the hidden units. For the 1-of-c coding scheme, the corresponding between-\\nclass covariance matrix, given by (6.109), contains coefficients which depend on \\nJVJt, the number of patterns in class Ck- Thus, the hidden unit representation \\nobtained by maximizing this discriminant function will only be optimal for a \\nparticular set of prior probabilities N^/N. If the prior probabilities differ between \\ntraining and test sets, then the feature extraction need not be optimal. \\nA related difficulty arises if there are different costs associated with different', 'misclassifications, so that a general loss matrix needs to be considered. It has \\nbeen suggested (Lowe and Webb, 1990, 1991) that modifications to the form of \\nthe sum-of-squares error to take account of the loss matrix can lead to improved \\nfeature extraction by the hidden layer, and hence to improved classification per\\xad\\nformance. \\nTo deal with different prior probabilities between the training set and the \\ntest set, Lowe and Webb (1990) modify the sum-of-squares error by introducing \\na weighting factor nn for each pattern n so that the error function becomes \\nwhere the weighting factors are given by \\nKn — for pattern n in class C& (6.113) \\nwhere P(Ck) is the prior probability of class Ck for the test data, and Pk = N^/N \\nis the corresponding (sample estimate of the) prior probability for the training \\ndata. It is straightforward to show (Exercise 6.12) that the total covariance \\nmatrix ST then becomes \\nfe k nee*', 'which is the sample-based estimate of the total covariance matrix for data with \\nprior class probabilities P(C^). In (6.114) the z are given by \\n* \" n€Ck \\nwhich again is the sample-based estimate of the value which z would take for \\ndata having the prior probabilities P{Ck). Similarly, assuming a 1-of-c target 230 6: Error Functions \\ncoding scheme, the between-class covariance matrix is modified to become \\nSB = £ N2P(Ckf(zk - z)(zk - z)T (6.116) \\nk \\nwhich is the sample-based estimate of the between-class covariance matrix for \\ndata with prior probabilities P(Ck)-\\nThe effects of an arbitrary loss matrix can similarly be taken into account \\nby modifying the target coding scheme so that, for a pattern n which is labelled \\nas belonging to class Cj, the target vector has components Vfc — 1 — L^, where \\nL(fc represents the loss in assigning a pattern from class C; to class Cfc. The \\ntotal covariance matrix is unaltered, while the between-class covariance matrix \\nbecomes (Exercise 6.13)', 'sB = ^{E(1--L\"t)Ar\\'^-^}{E(1-L\\'\\'fc)JV\\'\\'^\\'-z)T} (6117) \\nwhich reduces to the usual expression when Lik = 1 — b~ik- Examples of the \\napplication of these techniques to a problem in medical prognosis are given in \\nLowe and Webb (1990). \\n6.7 Cross-entropy for two classes \\nWe have seen that, for a 1-of-c target coding scheme, the outputs of a network \\ntrained by minimizing a sum-of-squares error function approximate the posterior \\nprobabilities of class membership, conditioned on the input vector. However, the \\nsum-of-squares error was obtained from the maximum likelihood principle by \\nassuming the target data was generated from a smooth deterministic function \\nwith added Gaussian noise. This is clearly a sensible starting point for regression \\nproblems. For classification problems, however, the targets are binary variables, \\nand the Gaussian noise model does not provide a good description of their dis\\xad\\ntribution. We therefore seek more appropriate choices of error function.', \"To start with, we consider problems involving two classes. One approach to \\nsuch problems would be to use a network with two output units, one for each \\nclass. This type of representation is discussed in Section 6.9. Here we discuss an \\nalternative approach in which we consider a network with a single output y. We \\nwould like the value of y to represent the posterior probability P(Ci |x) for class \\nC\\\\. The posterior probability of class C<i will then by given by P(C2|x) — \\\\—y. \\nThis can be achieved if we consider a target coding scheme for which t = 1 if \\nthe input vector belongs to class C\\\\ and t = 0 if it belongs to class &. We can \\ncombine these into a single expression, so that the probability of observing either \\ntarget value is \\np(*|x) = j,'(l - y)1-' (6.118) 6.7: Cross-entropy for two classes 231 \\nwhich is a particular case of the binomial distribution called the Bernoulli dis\\xad\\ntribution. With this interpretation of the output unit activations, the likelihood\", 'of observing the training data set, assuming the data points are drawn indepen\\xad\\ndently from this distribution, is then given by \\nnyn1-*/\")1-4\"- (6-iig) \\nAs usual, it is more convenient to minimize the negative logarithm of the like\\xad\\nlihood. This leads to the cross-entropy error function (Hopfield, 1987; Baum \\nand Wilczek, 1988; Solla et al, 1988; Hinton, 1989; Hampshire and Pearlmutter, \\n1990) in the form \\nE = -J2 {tn I\" yn + (1 - *n) ln(l - yn)} . (6.120) \\nWe shall discuss the meaning of the term \\'entropy\\' in Section 6.10. For the \\nmoment let us consider some elementary properties of this error function. \\nDifferentiating the error function with respect to yn we obtain \\n«£ = fr\"-\\'\") (6 121) \\ndy\" yn{l-yn)\\' \\nThe absolute minimum of the error function occurs when \\nyn = tn for all n. (6.122) \\nIn Section 3.1.3 we showed that, for a network with a single output y — g(a) \\nwhose value is to be interpreted as a probability, it is appropriate to consider \\nthe logistic activation function', '9(a) = ,, 1. . (6.123) \\n1 + exp(—a) \\nwhich has the property \\ng\\'(a) = g(a)(l-g(a)). (6.124) \\nCombining (6.121) and (6.124) we see that the derivative of the error with respect \\nto o takes the simple form \\n6» = ~=y»-tn. (6.125) 232 6: Error Functions \\nHere 6\" is the \\'error\\' quantity which is back-propagated through the network in \\norder to compute the derivatives of the error function with respect to the network \\nweights (Section 4.8). Note that (6.125) has the same form as obtained for the \\nsum-of-squares error function and linear output units. We see that there is a \\nnatural pairing of error function and output unit activation function which gives \\nrise to this simple form for the derivative. Use of the logistic form of activation \\nfunction also leads to corresponding simplifications when evaluating the Hessian \\nmatrix (the matrix of second derivatives of the error function). \\nFrom (6.120) and (6.122), the value of the cross-entropy error function at its \\nminimum is given by', 'Emin = -£{i\"ln*\" + (1 - t\")Hl - *»)}. (6.126) \\nn \\nFor the 1-of-c coding scheme this vanishes. However, the error function (6.120) \\nis also the correct one to use when tn is a continuous variable in the range (0,1) \\nrepresenting the probability of the input vector xn belonging to class C\\\\ (see \\nSection 6.10 and Exercise 6.15). In this case the minimum value (6.126) of the \\nerror need not vanish, and so it is convenient to subtract off this value from the \\noriginal error function to give a modified error of the form \\nE = - E {*\"ln £ + o - nln fr^j} • (6-127) \\nSince (6.126) is independent of the network outputs this does not affect the \\nlocation of the minimum and so has no effect on network training. The modified \\nerror (6.127) always has its minimum at 0, irrespective of the particular training \\nset. \\nAs a simple illustration of the interpretation of network outputs as probabili\\xad\\nties, we consider a simple two-class problem with one input variable in which the', \"class-conditional densities are given by the Gaussian mixture functions shown \\nin Figure 6.11. A multi-layer perceptron with five hidden units having 'tanh' \\nactivation functions, and one output unit having a logistic sigmoid activation \\nfunction, was trained by minimizing a cross-entropy error using 100 cycles of \\nthe BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm (Section 7.10). The resulting network map\\xad\\nping function is shown, along with the true posterior probability calculated using \\nBayes' theorem, in Figure 6.12. \\n6.7.1 Sigmoid activation functions \\nIn Section 3.1.3, the logistic sigmoid activation function was motivated for a \\nsingle-layer network by the goal of ensuring that the network outputs represent \\nposterior probabilities, with the assumption that the class-conditional densities \\ncan be approximated by normal distributions. We can apply a similar argument \\nto the network outputs in the case of multi-layered networks (Rumelhart et 6.7: Cross-entropy for two classes 233\", 'Figure 6.11. Plots of the class-conditional densities used to generate a data set \\nto demonstrate the interpretation of network outputs as posterior probabilities. \\nA total of 2000 data points were generated from these densities, using equal \\nprior probabilities. \\nal., 1995). In this case we need to consider the distributions of the outputs of \\nthe hidden units, represented here by the vector z for the two classes. We can \\ngeneralize the discussion by assuming that these class-conditional densities are \\ndescribed by \\np(z\\\\Ck) = exp [A{ek) + B(z, cj>) + 8jz} (6.128) \\nwhich is a member of the exponential family of distributions (which includes \\nmany of the common distributions as special cases such as Gaussian, binomial, \\nBernoulli, Poisson, and so on).

Provided such units use logistic sigmoid activation functions, \\nwe can interpret their outputs as probabilities of the presence of corresponding \\n\\'features\\' conditioned on the inputs to the units. \\nggps?-- \"T\"^>\\'J$SS 6.7: Cross-entropy for two classes 235 \\n6.7.2 Properties of the cross-entropy error \\nSuppose we write the network output, for a particular pattern n, in the form \\nyn = tn + en. Then the cross-entropy error function (6.127) can be written as \\nE = - ]T {tn ln(l + en/tn) + (1 - tn) ln(l - en/(l - tn))} (6.134) \\nn \\nso that the error function depends on the relative errors of the network outputs. \\nThis should be compared with the sum-of-squares error function which depends \\non the (squares of the) absolute errors.

In \\nthis case the minimum of the error function need not vanish (it represents the \\nentropy of the distribution of target variables, as will be discussed shortly). It is \\nthen convenient to subtract off this minimum value, and hence obtain the error \\nfunction in the form \\n* = -££*;> (f) (615°) \\nwhich is non-negative, and which equals zero when y% = t% for all k and n. \\nWe now consider the corresponding activation function which should be used \\nfor the network output units. If the output values are to be interpreted as prob\\xad\\nabilities they must lie in the range (0,1), and they must sum to unity. This can \\nbe achieved by using a generalization of the logistic sigmoid activation function \\nwhich takes the form \\nVk = ^ —, 7 (6.151) \\nXJfc,exp(afc.) \\nwhich is known as the normalized exponential, or softmax activation function', \"(Bridle, 1990). The term softmax is used because this activation function rep\\xad\\nresents a smooth version of the winner-takes-all activation model in which the \\nunit with the largest input has output +1 while all other units have output 0. \\nIf the exponentials in (6.151) are modified to have the form exp(/?ajt), then the \\nwinner-takes-all activation is recovered in the limit /? —* oo. The softmax activa\\xad\\ntion function can be regarded as a generalization of the logistic function, since \\nit can be written in the form \\nVk = L—— (6.152) \\nyk l+exp(-^fc) v ; \\nwhere vtfc is given by \\nM = ak - In < ^2 exp(ajfc<) > . (6.153) \\n[k'^k J \\nAs with the logistic sigmoid, we can give a very general motivation for the \\nsoftmax activation function by considering the posterior probability that a hid\\xad\\nden unit activation vector z belongs to class Cjt, in which the class-conditional \\ndensities are assumed to belong to the family of exponential distributions of the\", 'general form 6.9: Cross-entropy for multiple classes 239 \\np(z|Cfc) = exp { A(0fc) + B(z, <£) + 0^z} .

(6.159) \\nThe result (6.156) represents the final layer of a network with softmax activation \\nfunctions, and shows that (provided the distribution (6.154) is appropriate) the \\noutputs can be interpreted as probabilities of class membership, conditioned on \\nthe outputs of the hidden units. \\nIn evaluating the derivatives of the softmax error function we need to consider \\nthe inputs to all output units, and so we have (for pattern n) \\ndEn -^ dEn dyk \\n•EES- <\"»> \\nFrom (6.151) we have \\nwhile from (6.150) we have dak ^f dyk> dak \\n-zr~ = Vk\\'hk\\' - Vk\\'Vk (6.161) \\n8En =_<fe1', \"dyk' Vk' (6.162) \\nSubstituting (6.161) and (6.162) into (6.160) we find 240 6: Error Functions \\n9En \\n-Z—=Vk-tk (6.163) \\noak \\nwhich is the same result as found for both the sum-of-squares error (with a \\nlinear activation function) and the two-class cross-entropy error (with a logistic \\nactivation function). Again, we see that there is a natural pairing of error function \\nand activation function. \\n6.10 Entropy \\nThe concept of entropy was originally developed by physicists in the context of \\nequilibrium thermodynamics and later extended through the development of sta\\xad\\ntistical mechanics. It was introduced into information theory by Shannon (1948). \\nAn understanding of basic information theory leads to further insights into the \\nentropy-based error measures discussed in this section. It also paves the way for \\nan introduction to the minimum description length framework in Section 10.10. \\nHere we consider two distinct but related interpretations of entropy, the first\", 'based on degree of disorder and the second based on information content. \\nConsider a probability density function p(x) for a single random variable x. \\nIt is convenient to represent the density function as a histogram in which the \\nx-axis has been divided into bins labelled by the integer i. Imagine constructing \\nthe histogram by putting a total of TV identical discrete objects into the bins, \\nsuch that the ith bin contains TV,- objects. We wish to count the number of \\ndistinct ways in which objects can be arranged, while still giving rise to the \\nsame histogram. Since there are TV ways of choosing the first object, (TV — 1) \\nways of choosing the second object, and so on, there a total of TV! ways to select \\nthe TV objects. However, we do not wish to count rearrangements of objects \\nwithin a single bin. For the ith bin there are TVj! such rearrangements and so the \\ntotal number of distinct ways to arrange the objects, known as the multiplicity, \\nis given by \\n^ = fW (6164)', 'The entropy is defined as (a constant times) the negative logarithm of the mul\\xad\\ntiplicity \\nS = ~j-\\\\nW = -jj{\\\\nN\\\\-J2lnNi\\'-}- (6-165) i \\nWe now consider the limit TV —+ oo, and make use of Stirling\\'s approximation \\nIn TV! ~ TV In TV - TV together with the relation J2i ^» — N< to Sive 6.10: Entropy 241 \\n300 \\n200 \\n100 S = 2.98 \\niMUMimr 0.0 300 \\n200 \\n100 \\n0 S=1.91 \\n|-\\nr-\\nr-T -i \\n\"J \\n\"h 0.5 1.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 \\n(a) (to) \\nFigure 6.13. Examples of two histograms, together with their entropy values \\ndefined by (6.166). The histograms were generated by sampling two Gaussian \\nfunctions with variance parameters a = 0.4 and a = 0.08, and each contain \\n1000 points. Note that the more compact distribution has a lower entropy. \\nwhere pi = Ni/N (as N —> oo) represents the probability corresponding to the ith \\nbin. The entropy therefore gives a measure of the number of different microstates \\n(arrangements of objects in the bins) which can give rise to a given macrostate', '(i.e. a given set of probabilities pi). A very sharply peaked distribution has a very \\nlow entropy, whereas if the objects are spread out over many bins the entropy is \\nmuch higher. The smallest value for the entropy is 0 and occurs when all of the \\nprobability mass is concentrated in one bin (so that one of the pj is 1 and all \\nthe rest are 0). Conversely the largest entropy arises when all of the bins contain \\nequal probability mass, so that pi = \\\\/M where M is the total number of bins. \\nThis is easily seen by maximizing (6.166) subject to the constraint YliPi — 1 \\nusing a Lagrange multiplier (Appendix C). An example of two histograms, with \\ntheir respective entropies, is shown in Figure 6.13. \\nFor continuous distributions (rather than histograms) we can take the limit \\nin which the number M of bins goes to infinity. If A is the width of each bin, \\nthen the probability mass in the ith bin is pi = p(a;i)A, and so the entropy can \\nbe written in the form', '5 = Urn y^p(xi)Aln{p(xi)A} (6.167) \\n-/ p(x) \\\\np(x) dx -f lim In A (6.168) 242 6: Error Functions \\nwhere we have used Jp(x)dx = 1. The second term on the right-hand side \\ndiverges in the limit M —> oo. In order to define a meaningful entropy measure \\nfor continuous distributions we discard this term, since it is independent of p(x), \\nand simply use the first term on the right-hand side of (6.168), which is called \\nthe differential entropy. This is reasonable, since if we measure the difference in \\nentropy between two distributions, the second term in (6.168) would cancel. For \\ndistributions which are functions of several variables, we define the entropy to \\nbe \\n5=- /p(x)lnp(x)dx (6.169) \\nwhere x = (xi,... , £,;)T. \\nIt is interesting to consider the form of distribution which gives rise to the \\nmaximum of the entropy function. In order to find a meaningful maximum it is \\nnecessary to constrain the variance of the distribution. For the case of a single', 'variable x on the infinite axis (—00,00), we maximize \\n/oo \\np(x)lnp(x)dx (6.170) \\n-CO \\nsubject to the constraints that the distribution be normalized and that the mean \\nand variance of the distribution have specified values \\n/oo \\np(x)dx = l (6.171) \\n-00 \\n/oo \\nxp{x)dx = n (6.172) \\n-CO \\n/OO \\n(x-n)2p(x)dx = a2. (6.173) \\n-00 \\nIntroducing Lagrange multipliers Ai, A2 and A3 (Appendix C) for each of the \\nconstraints, we can use calculus of variations (Appendix D) to maximize the \\nfunctional \\n/oo \\np(x) {lnp(.r) -r A, + A2.r + A.3(.r - A*)2} dx - Aj - \\\\2fi - \\\\3cr2 (6.174) \\n-00 \\nwhich leads to \\np{x) = exp {-1 - Aj - \\\\2x - X3(x - fx)2} . (6.175) 6.10: Entropy 243 \\nWe can solve for the Lagrange multipliers by back-substituting this expression \\ninto the constraint equations. This finally gives the expression for the maximizing \\ndistribution in the form \\n^)=(d^exp{-^}. <6-176) • \\nThus we see that the distribution having maximum entropy, for given mean and \\nvariance, is the Gaussian.', \"As a second viewpoint on the interpretation of entropy, let us consider the \\namount of information, or equivalently the 'degree of surprise', which is obtained \\nwhen we learn that a particular event has occurred. We expect that the informa\\xad\\ntion will depend on the probability p of the event, since if p = 1 then the event is \\ncertain to occur, and there is no surprise when the event is found to occur (and \\nso no information is received). Conversely, if the probability is low, then there \\nis a large degree of surprise in learning that it has occurred. We are therefore \\nlooking for a measure of information s(p) which is a continuous, monotonically \\nincreasing function of p and which is such that s(l) = 0. An appropriate ex\\xad\\npression can be obtained as follows. Consider two independent events A and B, \\nwith probabilities PA and ps • If we know that both events have occurred then \\nthe total information is S(PAPB)- If, however, we are first told that A has oc\\xad\", \"curred, then the residual information on learning that B has occurred must be \\nS(PAPB) ~ S(PA), which must equal S(PB) since knowledge that A has occurred \\nshould not affect the information resulting from learning that B occurred (since \\nthe events are independent). This leads to the following condition \\nS(PAPB) - S{PA) + S(PB)- (6.177) \\nProm this we can deduce that s(p2) = 2s(p) and by induction that s(pN) = \\nNs(p) for integer N. Similarly, s(p) = s([p1/N]w) = Ns(pl'N) and by extension \\ns(pM/jV) = (M/N)s(p). This implies that \\ns{px) = xs(p) (6.178) \\nfor rational x and hence, by continuity, for real x. If we define z = — log2 p, so \\nthatp = (1/2)*, then \\ns(p) = S((l/2)*) = ZS(l/2) = -8(l/2) log2(p). (6.179) \\nIt is conventional to choose s(l/2) = 1. The information is then expressed in \\nbits (binary digits). From now on we shall consider logarithms to base e (natural \\nlogarithms) in which case the information is expressed in nats. We see that the\", 'amount of information is proportional to the logarithm of the probability. This \\narises essentially because, for independent events, probabilities are multiplicative, « 244 6: Eiror Functions \\nwhile information is additive. \\nConsider a random variable a which can take values a^ with probabilities \\np{ctk)- If a sender wishes to transmit the value of a to a receiver, then the amount \\nof information (in bits) which this requires is — lnp(ajt) if the variable takes the \\nvalue ctk- Thus, the expected (average) information needed to transmit the value \\nof a is given by \\nS{a) = -J2 p(aib) In p(ak) (6.180) \\nwhich is the entropy of the random variable a. Thus S(a) as the average amount \\nof information received when the value of a is observed. The average length of \\na binary message (in nats) needed to transmit the value of a is at least equal to \\nthe entropy of a. This is known as the noiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948; \\nViterbi and Omura, 1979).', 'Returning to the case of continuous variables, denoted by the vector x, we \\nnote that in practice we do not know the true distribution p(x). If we encode the \\nvalue of x for transmission to a receiver, then we must (implicitly or explicitly) \\nchoose a distribution q(x) from which to construct the coding. The information \\nneeded to encode a value of x under this distribution is just — lng(x). If the \\nvariable x is drawn from a true distribution p(x) then the average information \\nneeded to encode x is given by \\n/ p(x)\\\\nq(x)dx (6.181) \\nwhich is the cross-entropy between the distributions q(x) and p(x). Comparison \\nwith (2.68) shows that this equals the negative log likelihood under the model \\ndistribution q(x) when the true distribution is p(x). It is also equal to the sum of \\nthe Kullback-Leibler distance between p(x) and q(x), given by (2.70), and the \\nentropy of p(x) since \\n- f p(x) In q(x)dx = - fp(x)ln^-dx- f p(x) In p(x)dx. (6.182)', 'We can easily show that, of all possible distributions q(x), the choice which \\ngives the smallest average information, i.e. the smallest value for the cross-\\nentropy, is the true distribution p(x) (Exercise 6.21). Since the entropy of p(x) \\nis independent of the distribution q(x), we see from (6.182) that minimization of \\nthe cross-entropy is equivalent to minimization of the Kullback-Leibler distance. \\nWe can apply the concept of cross-entropy to the training of neural networks. \\nFor a variable a which takes a discrete set of values a^ we can write (6.181) in \\nthe form 6.11: General conditions for outputs to be probabilities 245 \\n-£P(afc)InQ(afc). (6.183) \\nfc \\nConsider first a network with c outputs yk(x) representing the model probabili\\xad\\nties for x to belong to the corresponding classes C^. We shall suppose that we also \\nhave a set of target variables tk representing the corresponding true probabilities. \\nThen the cross-entropy becomes \\nc \\n-J2tkiayk(x). (6.184) \\nk=i', 'For a set of N data points which are assumed to be drawn independently from \\na common distribution, the information is additive and hence the total cross-\\nentropy is given by \\n-EE*gInyfc(x») (6.185) \\nwhich can be used as an error function for network training. We see that this \\nform of error function is valid not only when the targets ijj have a one-of-c coding \\n(representing precise knowledge of the true classes of the data) but also when \\nthey lie anywhere in the range 0 < t% < 1, subject to the constraint J^fc *fc = *> \\ncorresponding to probabilities of class membership. \\nFor two classes, we can consider a network with a single output y represent\\xad\\ning the model probability for membership of class C\\\\, with corresponding true \\nprobability t.

The discussion given here is based on that of \\nHampshire and Pearlmutter (1990). 246 6: Error Functions \\nAll of the error measures we are considering take the form of a sum over \\npatterns of an error term for each pattern E = Y2n ^n- We sna\" a\\'so *a\\'<e *ne \\nerror to be a sum over terms for each output unit separately.

This error is a \\nfunction of the adaptive parameters (weights and biases) in the network, which \\nwe can conveniently group together into a single W-dimensional weight vector \\nw with components W\\\\... w\\\\y-\\nIn Chapter 4 it was shown that, for a multi-layer perceptron, the derivatives', 'of an error function with respect to the network parameters can be obtained in a \\ncomputationally efficient way using back-propagation. We shall see that the use \\nof such gradient information is of central importance in finding algorithms for \\nnetwork training which are sufficiently fast to be of practical use for large-scale \\napplications. \\nThe problem of minimizing continuous, differentiable functions of many vari\\xad\\nables is one which has been widely studied, and many of the conventional ap\\xad\\nproaches to this problem are directly applicable to the training of neural net\\xad\\nworks. In this chapter we shall review several of the most important practical \\nalgorithms. One of the simplest of these is gradient descent, which has been de\\xad\\nscribed briefly in earlier chapters. Here we investigate gradient descent in more \\ndetail, and discuss its limitations. We then describe a number of heuristic modifi\\xad\\ncations to gradient descent which aim to improve its performance. Next we review', 'an important class of conventional optimization algorithms based on the con\\xad\\ncept of conjugate gradients, including a relatively recent variation called scaled \\nconjugate gradients. We then describe the other major class of conventional op\\xad\\ntimization algorithms known as quasi-Newton methods. Finally, we discuss the \\npowerful Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which is applicable specifically to a \\nsum-of-squares error function. There are many standard textbooks which cover \\nnon-linear optimization techniques, including Polak (1971), Gill et at. (1981), \\nDennis and Schnabel (1983), Luenberger (1984), and Fletcher (1987). \\nIt is sometimes argued that learning algorithms for neural networks should \\nbe local (in the sense of the network diagram) so that the computations needed \\nto update each weight can be performed using information available locally to \\nthat weight. This requirement may be motivated by interest in modelling biolog\\xad', 'ical neural systems or by the desire to implement network algorithms in parallel \\nhardware. Although the locality issue is relevant both to biological plausibility \\nand to hardware implementation, it represents only one facet of these issues, \\nand much more careful analyses are required. Since our goal is to find the most 254 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nE \\nw-, 1 \\nB / \\nw, \\ncs»y£ \\nFigure 7.1. Geometrical picture of the error function -E(w) as a surface sitting \\nabove weight space. Points A and B represent minima of the error function. \\nAt any point C, the local gradient of the error surface is given by the vector \\nV£. \\neffective techniques for pattern recognition, there is little point in introducing un\\xad\\nnecessary restrictions. We shall therefore regard the issue of locality as irrelevant \\nin the present context. \\nMost of the algorithms which are described in this chapter are ones which have \\nbeen found to have good performance in a wide range of applications. However,', 'different algorithms will perform best on different problems and it is therefore \\nnot possible to recommend a single universal optimization algorithm. Instead, \\nwe highlight the relative advantages and limitations of different algorithms as \\nthey are discussed. \\n7.1 Error surfaces \\nThe problem addressed in this chapter is to find a weight vector w which min\\xad\\nimizes an error function E(w). It is useful to have a simple geometrical picture \\nof the error minimization process, which can be obtained by viewing E(w) as \\nan error surface sitting above weight space, as shown in Figure 7.1. For net\\xad\\nworks having a single layer of weights, linear output-unit activation functions, \\nand a sum-of-squares error, the error function will be a quadratic function of \\nthe weights. In this case the error surface will have a general multidimensional \\nparabolic form. There is then a single minimum (or possibly a single continuum', 'of degenerate minima), which can be located by solution of a set of coupled linear \\nequations, as discussed in detail in Section 3.4.3. \\nHowever, for more general networks, in particular those with more than one \\nlayer of adaptive weights, the error function will typically be a highly non-linear \\nfunction of the weights, and there may exist many minima all of which satisfy \\nVE = 0 (7.1) 7.1: Error surfaces 255 \\nE \\nw \\nFigure 7.2. A schematic error function for a single parameter w, showing four \\nstationary points at which the local gradient of the error function vanishes. \\nPoint A is a local minimum, point B is a local maximum, point C is a saddle-\\npoint, and point D is the global minimum. \\nwhere VE denotes the gradient of E in weight space. The minimum for which \\nthe value of the error function is smallest is called the global minimum- while \\nother minima are called local minim.a. There may also be other points which', 'satisfy the condition (7.1) such as local maxima or saddlepoints. Any vector w \\nfor which this condition is satisfied is called a stationary point, and the different \\nkinds of stationary point are illustrated schematically in Figure 7.2. \\nAs a consequence of the non-linearity of the error function, it is not in general \\npossible to find closed-form solutions for the minima. Instead, we consider algo\\xad\\nrithms which involve a search through weight space consisting of a succession of \\nsteps of the form \\nw(r+l) = w(r) + AW(T) (7_2) \\nwhere r labels the iteration step. Different algorithms involve different choices \\nfor the weight vector increment Aw\\'7\"\\'. For some algorithms, such as conjugate \\ngradients and the quasi-Newton algorithms discussed later, the error function is \\nguaranteed not to increase as a result of a change to the weights (and hopefully \\nwill decrease). One potential disadvantage of such algorithms is that if they reach', \"a local minimum they will remain there forever, as there is no mechanism for \\nthem to escape (as this would require a temporary increase in the error function). \\nThe choice of initial weights for the algorithm then determines which minimum \\nthe algorithm will converge to. Also, the presence of saddlepoints, or regions \\nwhere the error function is very flat, can cause some iterative algorithms to \\nbecome 'stuck' for extensive periods of time, thereby mimicking local minima. \\nDifferent algorithms can exhibit different behaviour in the neighbourhood \\nof a minimum. If e'T' denotes the distance to the minimum at step r, then \\nconvergence often has the general form 256 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\ne (r + D Q, (£(r))L (7 3) \\nwhere L governs the order of convergence. Values of L = 1 and L — 2 are known \\nrespectively as linear and quadratic convergence. \\nIn Section 4.4 we discussed the high degree of symmetry which exists in\", 'the weight space of a multi-layered neural network. For instance, a two-layer \\nnetwork with M hidden units exhibits a symmetry factor of M\\\\2M. Thus, for \\nany point in weight space, there will be M\\\\2M equivalent points which generate \\nthe same network mapping, and which therefore give rise to the same value for the \\nerror function. Any local or global minimum will therefore be replicated a large \\nnumber of times throughout weight space. Of course, in a practical application it \\nis irrelevant which of these many equivalent solutions we use. Furthermore, the \\nalgorithms we shall be discussing make use of a local stepwise search through \\nweight space, and will be completely unaffected by the presence of the numerous \\nequivalent points elsewhere in weight space. \\nIn Section 6.1.3 we showed that the sum-of-squares error function, in the \\nlimit of an infinite data set, can be written as the sum of two terms \\nk J \\n+ ~£/{<^|x}-(tfc|x)2}p(x)dx (7.4)', 'where yk(x;w) denotes the activation of output unit k when the network is \\npresented with input vector x, and (£jt|x) denotes the conditional average of the \\ncorresponding target variable given by \\n(tfc|x>= ftkp(tk\\\\x)dtk. (7.5) \\nSince only the first term in (7.4) depends on the network weights, the global \\nminimum of the error is obtained when j/fc(x;w) = (ife|x). This can be regarded \\nas the optimal solution, as discussed in Section 6.1.3. In practice we must deal \\nwith finite data sets, however. If the network is relatively complex (for instance \\nif it has a large number of adaptive parameters) then the best generalization per\\xad\\nformance might be obtained from a local minimum, or from some other point in \\nweight space which is not a minimum of the error. This leads to a consideration \\nof techniques in which the generalization performance is monitored as a func\\xad\\ntion of time during the training, and the training is halted when the optimum', 'generalization is achieved. Such methods are discussed briefly in Section 9.2.4. 7.2: Local quadratic approximation 257 \\n7.2 Local quadratic approximation \\nA considerable degree of insight into the optimization problem, and into the \\nvarious techniques for solving it, can be obtained by considering a local quadratic \\napproximation to the error function. Consider the Taylor expansion of E(w) \\naround some point w in weight space \\nE(w) = E(w) + (w - w)Tb + -(w - w)TH(w - w) (7.6) \\nwhere b is defined to be the gradient of E evaluated at w \\nb = V£|~ (7.7) \\nand the Hessian matrix H is defined by \\ndE \\n(H)« = (7.8) dwiduij \\nFrom (7.6), the corresponding local approximation for the gradient is given by \\nVfi = b + H(w-w). (7.9) \\nFor points w which are close to w, these expressions will give reasonable approx\\xad\\nimations for the error and its gradient, and they form the basis for much of the \\nsubsequent discussion of optimization algorithms.', 'Consider the particular case of a local quadratic approximation around a \\npoint w* which is a minimum of the error function. In this case there is no linear \\nterm, since VE = 0 at w*, and (7.6) becomes \\nE{w) = £(w*) + i(w - w*)TH(w - w*) (7.10) \\nwhere the Hessian is evaluated at w*. In order to interpret this geometrically, \\nconsider the eigenvalue equation for the Hessian matrix \\nHUi = AiUi (7.11) \\nwhere the eigenvectors Uj form a complete orthonormal set (Appendix A) so \\nthat \\nnJn^Sij. (7.12) \\nWe now expand (w — w*) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors in the form 258 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nw-w* = ]TaiUi. (7.13) \\ni \\nSubstituting (7.13) into (7.10), and using (7.11) and (7.12), allows the error \\nfunction to be written in the form \\nJS(w) = 2S(w*) + i 5>a?. (7.14) \\ni \\nEquation (7.13) can be regarded as a transformation of the coordinate system \\nin which the origin is translated to the point w*, and the axes are rotated to', 'align with the eigenvectors (through the orthogonal matrix whose columns are \\nthe u;). This transformation is discussed in more detail in Appendix A. \\nA matrix II is said to be positive definite if \\nvTHv>0 for all v. (7.15) \\nSince the eigenvectors {u;} form a complete set, an arbitrary vector v can be \\nwritten \\nv = £/?4u, (7.16) \\ni \\nFrom (7.11) and (7.12) we then have \\nvTHv = ^A2A,- (7.17) \\ni \\nand so H will be positive definite if all of its eigenvalues are positive. In the new \\ncoordinate system whose basis vectors are given by the eigenvectors {uj}, the \\ncontours of constant E are ellipses centred on the origin, whose axes are aligned \\nwith the eigenvectors and whose lengths are inversely proportional to the square \\nroots of the eigenvalues, as indicated in Figure 7.3. For a one-dimensional weight \\nspace, a stationary point w* will be a minimum if \\ndE/dw\\\\w. > 0. (7.18) \\nThe corresponding result in d-dimensions is that the Hessian matrix, evaluated', 'at w*, should be positive definite (Exercise 7.1). \\n7.2.1 Use of gradient information \\nFor most of the network models and error functions which are discussed in earlier \\nchapters, it is possible to evaluate the gradient of the error function relatively \\nefficiently, for instance by means of the back-propagation procedure. The use of 7.3: Linear output units 259 \\nW2 \\nFigure 7.3. In the neighbourhood of a minimum w*, the error function can \\nbe approximated by a quadratic function. Contours of constant error are then \\nellipses whose axes are aligned with the eigenvectors U; of the Hessian ma\\xad\\ntrix, with lengths that are inversely proportional to the square roots of the \\ncorresponding eigenvectors A*. \\nthis gradient information can lead to significant improvements in the speed with \\nwhich the minima, of the error function can be located. We can easily see why \\nthis is so, as follows. \\nIn the quadratic approximation to the error function, given in (7.6), the', 'error surface is specified by the quantities b and H, which contain a total of \\nW(W + 3}/2 independent terms (since the matrix H is symmetric), where W \\nis the dimensionality of w (i.e. the total number of adaptive parameters in the \\nnetwork). The location of the minimum of this quadratic approximation therefore \\ndepends on 0(W2) parameters, and we should not expect to be able to locate the \\nminimum until we have gathered C?(W2) independent pieces of information. If \\nwe do not make use of gradient information, we would expect to have to perform \\nat least 0(W2) function evaluations, each of which would require 0(W) steps. \\nThus, the computational effort needed to find the minimum would scale like \\n0(WZ). \\nNow compare this with an algorithm which makes use of the gradient infor\\xad\\nmation. Since each evaluation of VE brings W items of information, we might \\nhope to find the minimum of the function in 0{W) gradient evaluations. Using', 'back-propagation, each such evaluation takes only 0(W) steps and so the min\\xad\\nimum could now be found in 0(W2) steps. This dramatically improved scaling \\nwith W strongly suggests that gradient information should be exploited, as is \\nthe case for the optimization algorithms discussed in this chapter. \\n7.3 Linear output units \\nAs discussed at length in Section 3.4.3, if a sum-of-squares error function is used, \\nand the network mapping depends linearly on the weights, then the minimization 2(!0 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nof the error function represents a linear problem, which can be solved exactly in \\na single step using singular value decomposition (SVD). If we consider a more \\ngeneral multi-layer network with linear output units, then the dependence of the \\nnetwork mapping on the final-layer weights will again be linear. This means that \\nthe partial optimization of a sum-of-squares error function with respect to these', 'weights (with all other parameters held fixed) can again be performed by linear \\nmethods, as discussed in Section 3.4.3. The computational effort involved in SVD \\nis often very much less than that required for general non-linear optimization, \\nwhich suggests that it may be worthwhile to use linear methods for the final-\\nlayer weights, and non-linear methods for all other parameters. This leads to the \\nfollowing hybrid procedure for optimizing the weights in such networks (Webb \\nand Lowe, 1988). \\nSuppose the final-layer weights are collected together into a vector wr,, with \\nthe remaining weights forming a vector w. The error function can then be ex\\xad\\npressed as E(wr,, w), which is a quadratic function of W£,. For any given value \\nof w we can perform a one-step exact minimization with respect to the WL using \\nSVD, in which w is held fixed. We denote the optimum Wr, by WL(W). A con\\xad\\nventional non-linear optimization method (such as conjugate gradients, or the', \"quasi-Newton methods to be described later) is used to minimize E with respect \\nto w. Every time the value of w is changed, the weights w/, are recomputed. We \\ncan therefore regard the final layer weights wt as evolving on a fast time-scale \\ncompared to the remaining weights w. Effectively, the non-linear optimization is \\nattempting to minimize a function E(wr,('w), w) with respect to w. An obvious \\nadvantage of this method is that the dimensionality of the effective search space \\nfor the non-linear algorithm is reduced, and we might hope that this would re\\xad\\nduce the number of training iterations which is required to find a good solution. \\nHowever, this is offset to some extent by the greater computational effort re\\xad\\nquired at each such step. Webb and Lowe (1988) show that, for some problems, \\nthis hybrid approach can yield better solutions, or can require less computational \\neffort, than full non-linear optimization of the complete network. \\n7.4 Optimization in practice\", 'In order to apply the algorithms described in this chapter to real problems, \\nwe need to address a variety of practical issues. Here we discuss procedures for \\ninitializing the weights in a network, criteria used to terminate training, and \\nnormalized error functions for assessing the performance of trained networks. \\nAll of the training algorithms which we consider in this chapter begin by \\ninitializing the weights in the network to some randomly chosen values. We have \\nalready seen that optimization algorithms which proceed by a steady monotonic \\nreduction in the error function can become stuck in local minima. A suitable \\nchoice of initial weights is therefore potentially important in allowing the train\\xad\\ning algorithm to produce a good set of weights, and in addition may lead to \\nimprovements in the speed of training. Even stochastic algorithms such as gradi\\xad\\nent descent, which have the possibility of escaping from local minima, can show', \"strong sensitivity to the initial conditions. The initialization of weights for radial 7.4: Optimization in practice 2C1 \\nbasis function networks has already been dealt with in Chapter 6. Here we shall \\nconcern ourselves with multi-layer perceptions having sigmoidal hidden-unit ac\\xad\\ntivation functions. \\nThe majority of initialization procedures in current use involve setting the \\nweights to randomly chosen small values. Random values are used in order to \\navoid problems due to symmetries in the network. The initial weight values are \\nchosen to be small so that sigmoidal activation functions are not driven into \\nthe saturation regions where g'(a) is very small (which would lead to small \\nVE, and consequently a very flat error surface). If the weights are too small, \\nhowever, all of the sigmoidal activation functions will be approximately linear, \\nwhich can again lead to slow training. This suggests that the summed inputs\", 'to the sigmoidal functions should be of order unity. A random initialization of \\nthe weights requires that some choice be made for the distribution function from \\nwhich the weights are generated. We now examine the choice of this distribution \\nin a little more detail. \\nWe shall suppose that the input values to the network Xi,... X4 have been \\nrescaled so as to have zero mean (xi) = 0 and unit variance (xf) = 1, where the \\nnotation (•) will be used to denote an average both over the training data set and \\nover all the choices of initial network weights. The pre-processing of input data \\nprior to network training, in order to achieve this normalization, is discussed \\nin more detail in Section 8.2. The weights are usually generated from a simple \\ndistribution, such as a spherically symmetric Gaussian, for convenience, and this \\nis generally taken to have zero mean, since there is no reason to prefer any other', 'specific point in weight space. The choice of variance a2 for the distribution can \\nbe important, however. For a unit in the first hidden layer, the activation is given \\nby V — 9(a) where \\nd \\na = V uiiXi. (719) \\ni=0 \\nSince the choice of weight values is uncorrelated with the inputs, the average of \\na is zero \\nd d \\n(a) = ^(wiXi) = X>*><^> = 0 (7.20) \\ni=0 1=0 \\nsince (XJ) = 0. Next consider the variance of a \\n(fl2> = ( (X>**) ( X>A J ) = £>?><*?> = °*d (7.21) \\n\\\\ \\\\i=0 ) \\\\j=0 J I «=0 \\nwhere a1 is the variance of the distribution of weights, and we have used the fact 262 7.- Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nthat the weight values are uncorrected and hence (WJ/WJ) = <5y<72, together with \\n(a:2) = 1. As we have discussed already, we would like a to be of order unity so \\nthat the activations of the hidden units are determined by the non-linear part \\nof the sigmoids, without saturating. From (7.21) this suggests that the standard', 'deviation of the distribution used to generate the initial weights should scale like \\na cc d^1/2. A similar argument can be applied to the weights feeding into any \\nother unit in the network, if we assume that the outputs of hidden units are \\nappropriately distributed. \\nSince a particular training run is sensitive to the initial conditions for the \\nweights, it is common practice to train a particular network many times using \\ndifferent weight initializations. This leads to a set of different networks whose \\ngeneralization performance can be compared by making use of independent data. \\nIn this case it is possible to keep the best network and simply discard the remain\\xad\\nder. However, improved prediction capability can often be achieved by forming \\na committee of networks from amongst the better ones found during the training \\nprocess, as discussed in Section 9.6. The use of multiple training runs also plays', 'a related role in building a mixture model for the distribution of weight values \\nin the Bayesian framework, as discussed in Section 10.7. \\nWhen using non-linear optimization algorithms, some choice must be made of \\nwhen to stop the training process. Some of the possible choices are listed below: \\n1. Stop after a fixed number of iterations. The problem with this approach \\nis that it is difficult to know in advance how many iterations would be \\nappropriate, although an approximate idea can be obtained from some \\npreliminary tests. If several networks are being trained (e.g. with various \\nnumbers of hidden units) then the appropriate number of iterations may \\nbe different for different networks. \\n2. Stop when a predetermined amount of CPU (central processing unit) time \\nhas been used. Again, it is difficult to know what constitutes a suitable \\ntime unless some preliminary tests are performed first. Some adjustment \\nfor different architectures may again be necessary.', '3. Stop when the error function falls below some specified value. This suffers \\nfrom the problem that the specified value may never be reached, so some \\nlimit on CPU time may also be required. \\n4. Stop when the relative change in error function falls below some speci\\xad\\nfied value. This may lead to premature termination if the error function \\ndecreases relatively slowly during some part of the training run. \\n5. Stop training when the error measured using an independent validation \\nset starts to increase. This approach is generally used as part of a strategy \\nto optimize the generalization performance of the network, and will be \\ndiscussed further in Section 9.2.4. \\nIn practice some combination of the above methods may be employed as part of \\na largely empirical process of parameter optimization. \\nSince the value of the error function depends on the number of patterns, it is \\nuseful to consider a normalized error function for the purposes of assessing the 7.5: Gradient descent 263', 'performance of a trained network. For a sum-of-squares error, an appropriate \\nchoice would be the normalized error function given by \\nE = ^*\">-?2 (7.22) \\n\\\\ £»l|t-t»|. \\nwhere t is the mean of the target data over the test set (Webb et o?., 1988). \\nThis error function equals unity when the model is as good a predictor of the \\ntarget data as the simple model y = t, and equals zero if the model predicts \\nthe data values exactly. A value of E of 0.1 will often prove adequate for simple \\nclassification problems, while for regression applications a significantly smaller \\nvalue may be needed. For reasons introduced in Chapter 1, and discussed at \\ngreater length in Chapter 9, the performance of the trained network should be \\nassessed using a data set which is independent of the training data. \\nFor classification problems, it is appropriate to test the performance of the \\ntrained network by assessing the number of misclassifications, or more generally', \"the value of the total loss (Section 1.10). \\n7.5 Gradient descent \\nOne of the simplest network training algorithms, and one which we have already \\nencountered several times in previous chapters, is gradient descent, sometimes \\nalso known as steepest descent. In the batch version of gradient descent, we start \\nwith some initial guess for the weight vector (which is often chosen at random) \\ndenoted by w^0'. We then iteratively update the weight vector such that, at step \\nr, we move a short distance in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of \\nthe error, i.e. in the direction of the negative gradient, evaluated at w*-T>: \\nAw<r' = -r, VE\\\\wM . (7.23) \\nNote that the gradient is re-evaluated at each step. In the sequential, or pattern-\\nbased, version of gradient descent, the error function gradient is evaluated for \\njust one pattern at a time, and the weights updated using \\nAw<T> = -n V£n|w(T, (7.24)\", 'where the different patterns n in the training set can be considered in sequence, or \\nselected at random. The parameter i] is called the learning rate, and, provided its \\nvalue is sufficiently small, we expect that, in the batch version (7.23) of gradient \\ndescent, the value of E will decrease at each successive step, eventually leading \\nto a weight vector at which the condition (7.1) is satisfied. \\nFor the sequential update (7.24) we might also hope for a steady reduction \\nin error since, for sufficiently small t], the average direction of motion in weight \\nspace should approximate the negative of the local gradient. In order to study this 264 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nmore carefully, we note that sequential gradient descent (7.24) is reminiscent of \\nthe Robbins-Monro procedure (Section 2.4.1) for finding the zero of a regression \\nfunction (in this case the error function gradient). The analogy becomes precise,', 'and we are assured of convergence, if the learning rate parameter r\\\\ is made to \\ndecrease at each step of the algorithm in accordance with the requirements of the \\ntheorem (Luo, 1991). These can be satisfied by choosing rfT^ ex 1/r, although \\nsuch a choice leads to very slow convergence. In practice, a constant value of r\\\\ is \\noften used as this generally leads to better results even though the guarantee of \\nconvergence is lost. There is still a serious difficulty with this approach, however. \\nIf j) is too large, the algorithm may overshoot leading to an increase in E and \\npossibly to divergent oscillations resulting in a complete breakdown in the algo\\xad\\nrithm. Conversely, if T) is chosen to be too small the search can proceed extremely \\nslowly, leading to very long computation times. Furthermore, the optimum value \\nfor T] will typically change during the course of the minimization. \\nAn important advantage of the sequential approach over batch methods arises', 'if there is a high degree of redundant information in the data set. As a simple ex\\xad\\nample, suppose that we create a larger training set from the original one simply \\nby replicating the original data set ten times. Every evaluation of E then takes \\nten times as long, and so a batch algorithm will take ten times as long to find a \\ngiven solution. By contrast, the sequential algorithm updates the weights after \\neach pattern presentation, and so will be unaffected by the replication of data. \\nLater in this chapter we describe a number of powerful optimization algorithms \\n(such as conjugate gradients and quasi-Newton methods) which are intrinsically \\nbatch techniques. For such algorithms it is still possible to gain some of the \\nadvantages of sequential techniques by grouping the data into blocks and pre\\xad\\nsenting the blocks sequentially as if each of them was representative of the whole \\ndata set. Some experimentation may be needed to determine a suitable size for \\nthe blocks.', 'Another potential advantage of the sequential approach is that, since it is a \\nstochastic algorithm, it has the possibility of escape from local minima. Later \\nin this chapter we shall discuss a number of algorithms which have the property \\nthat each step of the algorithm is guaranteed not to produce an increase in the \\nerror function. If such an algorithm finds its way into a local minimum it will \\ntypically remain there indefinitely. \\n7.5.1 Convergence \\nAs we have already indicated, one of the limitations of the gradient descent \\ntechnique is the need to choose a suitable value for the learning rate parameter \\nr). The problems with gradient descent do not stop there, however. Figure 7.4 \\ndepicts the contours of E, for a hypothetical two-dimensional weight space, in \\nwhich the curvature of E varies significantly with direction. At most points on the \\nerror surface, the local gradient does not point directly towards the minimum.', 'Gradient descent then takes many small steps to reach the minimum, and is \\nclearly a very inefficient procedure. \\nWe can gain deeper insight into the nature of this problem by considering 7.5: Gradient descent 265 \\n-VE \\nFigure 7.4. Schematic illustration of fixed-step gradient descent for an error \\nfunction which has substantially different curvatures along different directions. \\nEllipses depict contours of constant E, so that the error surface has the form of \\na long valley. The vectors ui and U2 represent the eigenvectors of the Hessian \\nmatrix. Note that, for most points in weight space, the local negative gradient \\nvector —V£ does not point towards the minimum of the error function. Suc\\xad\\ncessive steps of gradient descent can oscillate across the valley, with very slow \\nprogress along the valley towards the minimum. \\nthe quadratic approximation to the error function in the neighbourhood of the \\nminimum, discussed earlier in Section 7.2. From (7.10), (7.11) and (7.13), the', \"gradient of the error function in this approximation can be written as \\nV-E = ]TaiAiUi. (7.25) \\ni \\nFrom (7.13) we also have \\nAw=^AaiUi. (7.26) \\ni \\nCombining (7.25) with (7.26) and the gradient descent formula (7.23), and using \\nthe orthonormality relation (7.12) for the eigenvectors of the Hessian, we obtain \\nthe following expression for the change in aj at each step of the gradient descent \\nalgorithm \\nfrom which it follows that Aaj = -rjXiCti (7.27) \\n= (1 - n\\\\i)afd (7.28) \\nwhere 'old' and 'new' denote values before and after a weight update. Using the \\northonormality relation (7.12) for the eigenvectors, together with (7.13), we have 266 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nuT(w-w*) = oi (7.29) \\nand so a; can be interpreted as the distance to the minimum along the direction \\nu,. From (7.28) we see that these distances evolve independently such that, at \\neach step, the distance along the direction of u; is multiplied by a factor (1 —7/Aj). \\nAfter a total of T steps we have\", 'aP = (1 - „A,) V\" (7-30) \\nand so, provided |1 — ??Aj| < 1, the limit T —> oo leads to a,- = 0, which from \\n(7.29) shows that w = w* and so the weight vector has reached the minimum \\nof the error. Note that (7.30) demonstrates that gradient descent leads to linear \\nconvergence in the neighbourhood of a minimum. Also, convergence to the sta\\xad\\ntionary point requires that all of the A, be positive, which in turn implies that \\nthe stationary point is indeed a minimum (Exercise 7.1). \\nBy making n larger we can make the factor (1 — r/Aj) smaller and hence \\nimprove the speed of convergence. There is a limit to how large r\\\\ can be made, \\nhowever. We can permit (1 — r\\\\\\\\i) to go negative (which gives oscillating values of \\ntti) but we must ensure that |l-r/A,| < 1 otherwise the a, values will diverge. This \\nlimits the value of rj to 7? < 2/Amax where Amax is the largest of the eigenvalues. \\nThe rate of convergence, however, is dominated by the smallest eigenvalue, so', 'with r} set to its largest permitted value, the convergence along the direction \\ncorresponding to the smallest eigenvalue (the long axis of the ellipse in Figure 7.4) \\nwill be governed by \\nA _ \"^A (7.3i) \\nwhere Am;n is the smallest eigenvalue. If the ratio Amjn/Amax (whose reciprocal \\nis known as the condition number oi the Hessian) is very small, corresponding to \\nhighly elongated elliptical error contours as in Figure 7.4, then progress towards \\nthe minimum will be extremely slow. From our earlier discussion of quadratic \\nerror surfaces, we might expect to be able to find the minimum exactly using as \\nfew as W(W + 3)/2 error function evaluations. Gradient descent is an extremely \\ninefficient algorithm for error function minimization, since the number of function \\nevaluations can easily be very much greater than this. Later we shall encounter \\nalgorithms which are guaranteed to find the minimum of a quadratic error surface \\nexactly in a small, fixed number of steps which is 0(W2).', \"The gradient descent procedure we have described so far involves taking a \\nsuccession of finite steps through weight space. We can instead imagine the evolu\\xad\\ntion of the weight vector taking place continuously as a function of time r. The \\ngradient descent rule is then replaced by a set of coupled non-linear ordinary \\ndifferential equations of the form 7.5: Gradient descent 267 \\ndWi r, 9E (7 Ml \\n17 = ^ (7'32) \\nwhere w^ represents any weight parameter in the network. These equations cor\\xad\\nrespond to the motion of a massless particle with position vector w moving in a \\npotential field E(w) subject to viscous drag with viscosity coefficient t]~1. They \\nrepresent a set of ^^differential equations (ones characterized by several widely \\ndiffering time-scales) as a consequence of the fact that the Hessian matrix of\\xad\\nten has widely differing eigenvalues. The simple gradient descent formula (7.23) \\nrepresents a 'fixed-step forward Euler' technique for solving (7.32), which is a\", 'particularly inefficient approach for stiff equations. Application of specialized \\ntechniques for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (Gear, 1971) to the \\nsystem in (7.32) can give significant improvements in convergence time (Owens \\nand Filkin, 1989). \\n7.5.2 Momentum \\nOne very simple technique for dealing with the problem of widely differing eigen\\xad\\nvalues is to add a momentum term to the gradient descent formula (Plaut et al, \\n1986). This effectively adds inertia to the motion through weight space (Exer\\xad\\ncise 7.3) and smoothes out the oscillations depicted in Figure 7.4. The modified \\ngradient descent formula is given by \\nAw<r> = -TJ VE\\\\wM + //Aw^-1) (7.33) \\nwhere \\\\i is called the momentum parameter. \\nTo understand the effect of the momentum term, consider first the motion \\nthrough a region of weight space for which the error surface has relatively low \\ncurvature, as indicated in Figure 7.5. If we make the approximation that the', 'gradient is unchanging, then we can apply (7.33) iteratively to a long series of \\nweight updates, and then sum the resulting arithmetic series to give \\nAw=-t]VE{l + (i + fi2 + ...} (7.34) \\n1 /x \\nand we see that the result of the momentum term is to increase the effective \\nlearning rate from rj to tj/(l — /t). \\nBy contrast, in a region of high curvature in which the gradient descent is \\noscillatory, as indicated in Figure 7.6, successive contributions from the momen\\xad\\ntum term will tend to cancel, and the effective learning rate will be close to TJ. \\nThus, the momentum term can lead to faster convergence towards the minimum \\nwithout causing divergent oscillations. A schematic illustration of the effect of \\na momentum term is shown in Figure 7.7. From (7.35) we see that \\\\i must lie \\nbetween in the range 0 < n < 1. 2C8 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nFigure 7.5. With a fixed learning rate parameter, gradient descent down a', 'surface with low curvature leads to successively smaller steps (linear conver\\xad\\ngence). In such a situation, the effect of a momentum term is similar to an \\nincrease in the effective learning rate parameter. \\nFigure 7.6. For a situation in which successive steps of gradient descent are \\noscillatory, a momentum term has little influence on the effective value of the \\nlearning rate parameter. \\nThe inclusion of momentum generally leads to a significant improvement in \\nthe performance of gradient descent. Nevertheless, the algorithm remains rela\\xad\\ntively inefficient. The inclusion of momentum also introduces a second parameter \\n/i whose value needs to be chosen, in addition to that of the learning rate pa\\xad\\nrameter T). \\n7.5.3 Enhanced gradient descent \\nAs we have seen, gradient descent, even with a momentum term included, is not a \\nparticularly efficient algorithm for error function minimization. There have been', 'numerous attempts in recent years to improve the performance of basic gradient 7.5: Gradient descent 269 \\nFigure 7.7. Illustration of the effect of adding a momentum term to the gradient \\ndescent algorithm, showing the more rapid progress along the valley of the error \\nfunction, compared with the unmodified gradient descent shown in Figure 7.4. \\ndescent for neural network training by making various ad hoc modifications. \\nWe shall not attempt to review them all here as the literature is much too \\nextensive, and we will shortly be considering several robust, theoretically well-\\nfounded optimization algorithms. Instead we consider a few illustrative examples \\nof such techniques which attempt to address various deficiencies of the basic \\ngradient descent procedure. \\nOne obvious problem with simple gradient descent plus momentum is that \\nit contains two parameters, r\\\\ and p., whose values must be selected by trial and', 'error. The optimum values for these parameters will depend on the particular \\nproblem, and will typically vary during training. We might therefore seek some \\nprocedure for setting these automatically as part of the training algorithm. One \\nsuch approach is the bold driver technique (Vogl et al., 1988; Battiti, 1989). \\nConsider the situation without a momentum term first. The idea is to check \\nwhether the error function has actually decreased after each step of the gradient \\ndescent. If it has increased then the algorithm must have overshot the minimum \\n(i.e. the minimum along the direction of the weight change) and so the learning \\nrate parameter must have been too large. In this case the weight change is \\nundone, and the learning rate is decreased. This process is repeated until a \\ndecrease in error is found. If, however, the error decreased at a given step, then \\nthe new weight values are accepted. However, the learning rate might have been', 'too small, and so its value is increased. This leads to the following prescription \\nfor updating the learning rate parameter: \\n_ f prm if A£ < 0 . . \\nVn™ ~ \\\\atUM i(AE>0. (1-6b) \\nThe parameter p is chosen to be slightly larger than unity (a typical value might \\nbe p = 1.1) in order to avoid frequent occurrences of an error increase, since \\nin such cases the error evaluation is wasted. The parameter a is taken to be \\nsignificantly less than unity (a = 0.5 is typical) so that the algorithm quickly \\nreverts to finding a step which decreases the error, again to minimize wasted \\ncomputation. Many variations of this heuristic are possible, such as increasing Tj 270 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nlinearly (by a fixed increment) rather than exponentially (by a fixed factor). If we \\ninclude momentum in the bold driver algorithm, the momentum coefficient can \\nbe set to some fixed value (selected in an ad hoc fashion), but the weight update', 'is usually reset along the negative gradient direction after every occurrence of an \\nerror function increase, which is equivalent to setting the momentum coefficient \\ntemporarily to zero (Vogl et al, 1988). \\nA more principled approach to setting the optimal learning rate parameter \\nwas introduced by Le Cun et al. (1993). In Section 7.5.1 we showed that the \\nlargest value which can be used for the learning rate parameter was given by \\n??max = 2/Amax, where Amax is the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. It is \\neasily shown (Exercise 7.5) that if an arbitrary vector is alternately normalized \\nand then multiplied by the Hessian, it eventually converges to Amax times the \\ncorresponding eigenvector. The length of this vector then gives Amax itself. Eval\\xad\\nuation of the product of the Hessian with a vector can be performed efficiently by \\nusing the 7?.{}-operator technique discussed in Section 4.10.7. Once a suitable', 'value for the learning rate has been determined, the standard gradient descent \\ntechnique is applied. \\nWe have already noted that the (negative) gradient vector need not point \\ntowards the error function minimum, even for a quadratic error surface, as in\\xad\\ndicated in Figure 7.4. In addition, we have seen that long narrow valleys in the \\nerror function, characterized by a Hessian matrix with widely differing eigenval\\xad\\nues, can lead to very slow progress down the valley, as a consequence of the need \\nto keep the learning rate small in order to avoid divergent oscillations across \\nthe valley. One approach that has been suggested for dealing with this problem \\n(Jacobs, 1988) is to introduce a separate learning rate for each weight in the \\nnetwork, with procedures for updating these learning rates during the training \\nprocess. The gradient descent rule then becomes \\nMr) = -rfr)^- (7-37) \\nHeuristically, we might wish to increase a particular learning rate when the', 'derivative of E with respect to the corresponding parameter has the same sign \\non consecutive steps since this weight is moving steadily in the downhill direction. \\nConversely, if the sign of the gradient changes on consecutive steps, this signals \\noscillation, and the learning rate parameter should be decreased. \\nOne way to implement this is to take \\nAr4r) = ig^g^ (7-38) \\nwhere \\nglT) = -^ (7-39) 7.5: Gradient descent 271 \\nand 7 > 0 is a step-size parameter. This prescription is called the delta-delta \\nrule (since, in Jacobs (1988) the notation 5{ was used instead of <?j to denote \\nthe components of the local gradient vector). For the case of a quadratic error \\nsurface, it can be derived by minimizing the error with respect to the learning \\nrate parameters (Exercise 7.6). This rule does not work well in practice since it \\ncan lead to negative values for the learning rate, which results in uphill steps, \\nunless the value of 7 is set very small, in which case the algorithm exhibits', 'little improvement over conventional gradient descent. A modification to the \\nalgorithm, known as the delta-bar-delta rule is to take \\nAt7(T) -i K if 3«T-1)SiT) > ° (7 AQ\\\\ \\nI -Hi »f 91 91 < 0 \\nwhere \\n&(T) = (l-%iT)+*3,(r-1) (7.41) \\nso that g is an exponentially weighted average of the current and previous val\\xad\\nues of g. This algorithm appears to work moderately well in practice, at least \\nfor some problems. One of its obvious drawbacks, however, is that it now con\\xad\\ntains four parameters (0, d>, K and (i) if we include momentum. A more serious \\ndifficulty is that the algorithm rests on the assumption that we can regard the \\nweight parameters as being relatively independent. This would be the case for a \\nquadratic error function if the Hessian matrix were diagonal (so that the major \\naxes of the ellipse in Figure 7.3 were aligned with the weight axes). In practice, \\nthe weights in a typical neural network are strongly coupled, leading to a Hessian', 'matrix which is often far from diagonal. The solution to this problem lies in a \\nnumber of standard optimization algorithms which we shall discuss shortly. \\nAnother heuristic scheme, known as quickprop (Fahlman, 1988), also treats \\nthe weights as if they were quasi-independent. The idea is to approximate the \\nerror surface, as a function of each of the weights, by a quadratic polynomial (i.e. \\na parabola), and then to use two successive evaluations of the error function, and \\nan evaluation of its gradient, to determine the coefficients of the polynomial. At \\nthe next step of the iteration, the weight parameter is moved to the minimum of \\nthe parabola. This leads to an expression for the weight update at step r given \\nby (Exercise 7.7) \\nA-iT+1) = (.if (T)A\"4T). (7-42) 91 ~9i \\nThe algorithm can be started using a single step of gradient descent. This assumes \\nthat the result of the local quadratic fit is to give a parabola with a minimum.', 'If instead it leads to a parabola with a maximum, the algorithm can take an \\ni 272 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nuphill step. Also, some bound on the maximum size of step needs to be imposed \\nto deal with the problem of a nearly flat parabola, and several other fixes are \\nneeded in order to get the algorithm to work in practice. \\n7.6 Line search \\nThe algorithms which are described in this chapter involve taking a sequence of \\nsteps through weight space. It is convenient to consider each of these steps in \\ntwo parts. First we must decide the direction in which to move, and second, we \\nmust decide how far to move in that direction. With simple gradient descent, the \\ndirection of each step is given by the local negative gradient of the error func\\xad\\ntion, and the step size is determined by an arbitrary learning rate parameter. \\nWe might expect that a better procedure would be to move along the direction', 'of the negative gradient to find the point at which the error is minimized. More \\ngenerally we can consider some search direction in weight space, and then find \\nthe minimum of the error function along that direction. This procedure is re\\xad\\nferred to as a line search, and it forms the basis for several algorithms which \\nare considerably more powerful than gradient descent. We first consider how line \\nsearches can be implemented in practice. \\nSuppose that at step r in some algorithm the current weight vector is w\\'7\"^, \\nand we wish to consider a particular search direction d\\'T\\' through weight space. \\nThe minimum along the search direction then gives the next value for the weight \\nvector: \\nw(r+l)=w(r)+A(r)d(T) (743) \\nwhere the parameter X^ is chosen to minimize \\nE(X) = £(w(r) + Ad^). (7.44) \\nThis gives us an automatic procedure for setting the step length, once we have \\nchosen the search direction. \\nThe line search represents a one-dimensional minimization problem. A simple', 'approach would be to proceed along the search direction in small steps, evalu\\xad\\nating the error function at each new position, and stop when the error starts to \\nincrease (Hush and Salas, 1988). It is possible, however, to find very much more \\nefficient approaches (Press et ai, 1992). Consider first the issue of whether to \\nmake use of gradient information in performing a line search. We have already \\nargued that there is generally a substantial advantage to be gained from using \\ngradient information for the general problem of seeking the minimum of the er\\xad\\nror function E in the W-dimensional weight space. For the sub-problem of line \\nsearch, however, the argument is somewhat different. Since this is now a one-\\ndimensional problem, both the value of the error function and the gradient of the \\nerror function each represent just one piece of information. An error function cal\\xad\\nculation requires one forward propagation and hence needs ~ 2JVW operations, 7.6: Line search 273 \\nE \\nX', 'Figure 7.8. An example of an error function which depends on a parameter A \\ngoverning distance along the search direction, showing a minimum which has \\nbeen bracketed. The three points a < b < c are such that E(a) > E(b) and \\nE(c) > E(b). This ensures that the minimum lies somewhere in the interval \\n(a,c). \\nwhere N is the number of patterns in the data set. An error function gradient \\nevaluation, however, requires a forward propagation, a backward propagation, \\nand a set of multiplications to form the derivatives. It therefore needs ~ 5NW \\noperations, although it does allow the error function itself to be evaluated as \\nwell. On balance, the line search is slightly more efficient if it makes use of error \\nfunction evaluations only. \\nEach line search proceeds in two stages. The first stage is to bracket the \\nminimum by finding three points a < 6 < c along the search direction such that \\nE(a) > E(b) and E(c) > E(b), as shown in Figure 7.8. Since the error function', \"is continuous, this ensures that there is a minimum somewhere in the interval \\n(a, c) (Press et al., 1992). The second stage is to locate the minimum itself. Since \\nthe error function is smooth and continuous, this can be achieved by a process of \\nparabolic interpolation. This involves fitting a quadratic polynomial to the error \\nfunction evaluated at three successive points, and then moving to the minimum \\nof the parabola, as illustrated in Figure 7.9. The process can be repeated by \\nevaluating the error function at the new point, and then fitting a new parabola \\nto this point and two of the previous points. In practice, several refinements are \\nalso included, leading to the very robust Brent's algorithm (Brent, 1973). Line-\\nsearch algorithms, and termination criteria, are reviewed in Luenberger (1984). \\nAn important issue concerns the accuracy with which the line searches are \\nperformed. Depending on the particular algorithm in which the line search is to\", 'be used, it may be wasteful to invest too much computational time in evaluating \\nthe minimum along each search direction to high accuracy. We shall return to \\nthis point later. For the moment, we make one comment regarding the limit of \\naccuracy which can be achieved in a line search. Near a minimum at XQ, tne \\nerror function along the search direction can be approximated by 274 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nFigure 7.9. An illustration of the process of parabolic interpolation used to \\nperform line-search minimization. The solid curve depicts the error as a func\\xad\\ntion of distance A along the search direction, and the error is evaluated at \\nthree points a < b < c which are such that E(a) > E(b) and E(c) > E{b). \\nA parabola (shown dotted) is fitted to the three points a, b, c. The minimum \\nof the parabola, at d, gives an approximation to the minimum of E(X). The \\nprocess can be repeated by fitting another parabola through three points given', 'by d and whichever of two of the previous points have the smallest error values \\n(6 and c in this example). \\nE{\\\\) E(\\\\0) + ^E\"(A0)(A - A0)2. (7.45) \\nThus A — Ao must typically be at least of the order of the square root of the \\nmachine precision before the difference between E(X) and JB(AO) is significant. \\nThis limits the accuracy with which the minimum can be found. For double-\\nprecision arithmetic this implies that the minimum can only be found to a relative \\naccuracy of approximately 3 x 10~8. In practice is may be better to settle for \\nmuch lower accuracy than this. \\n7.7 Conjugate gradients \\nIn the previous section we considered procedures for line-search minimization \\nalong a specified search direction. To apply line search to the problem of error \\nfunction minimization we need to choose a suitable search direction at each stage \\nof the algorithm. Suppose we have already minimized along a search direction', 'given by the local negative gradient vector. We might suppose that the search \\ndirection at the next iteration should be given by the negative gradient vector \\nat the new position. However, the use of successive gradient vectors turns out in \\ngeneral not to represent the best choice of search direction. To see why, we note \\nthat at the minimum of the line search we have, from (7.44) \\nd_ £(w<T> + Ad(T)) = 0 (7.46) 7.7: Conjugate gradients 275 \\ncontours of \\nconstant E \\n(T-l) \\nFigure 7.10. After a line minimization, the new gradient is orthogonal to the \\nline-search direction. Thus, if the search directions are always chosen to co\\xad\\nincide with the negative gradients of the error function, as indicated here, \\nthen successive search directions will be orthogonal, and the error function \\nminimization will typically proceed very slowly. \\nwhich gives \\ng <*-+l>Td(r) = 0 (7.47) \\nwhere g = VE. Thus, the gradient at the new minimum is orthogonal to the', \"previous search direction, as illustrated geometrically in Figure 7.10. Choosing \\nsuccessive search directions to be the local (negative) gradient directions can \\nlead to the problem already indicated in Figure 7.4 in which the search point \\noscillates on successive steps while making little progress towards the minimum. \\nThe algorithm can then take many steps to converge, even for a quadratic error \\nfunction. \\nThe solution to this problem lies in choosing the successive search directions \\nd^ such that, at each step of the algorithm, the component of the gradient \\nparallel to the previous search direction, which has just been made zero, is un\\xad\\naltered (to lowest order). This is illustrated in Figure 7.11. Suppose we have \\nalready performed a line minimization along the direction d'T\\\\ starting from \\nthe point w^T\\\\ to give the new point w(T+1'. Then at the point w^T+1' we have \\ng(w(-+l))Td(r)=0. (7.48) \\nWe now choose the next search direction d'T+1' such that, along this new direc\\xad\", \"tion, we retain the property that the component of the gradient parallel to the \\nprevious search direction remains zero (to lowest order). Thus we require that \\ng(w<T+1> + Ad<T+1>)Td<T> = 0 (7.49) 276 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nFigure 7.11. This diagram illustrates the concept of conjugate directions. Sup\\xad\\npose a line search has been performed along the direction d^T' starting from \\nthe point w'T\\\\ to give an error minimum along the search path at the point \\n•w^+i). The direction d'T+1) is said to be conjugate to the direction d^ if \\nthe component of the gradient parallel to the direction d'T^, which has just \\nbe made zero, remains zero (to lowest order) as we move along the direction \\nd(T+1>. \\nas shown in Figure 7.11. If we now expand (7.49) to first order in A, and note \\nthat the zeroth-order term vanishes as a consequence of (7.48), we obtain \\nd(T+DTHd(r) = 0 (760) \\nwhere H is the Hessian matrix evaluated at the point w'T+1). If the error surface\", 'is quadratic, this relation holds for arbitrary values of A in (7.49) since the \\nHessian matrix is constant, and higher-order terms in the expansion of (7.49) \\nin powers of A vanish. Search directions which satisfy (7.50) are said to be non-\\ninterfering or conjugate. In fact, we shall see that it is possible to construct a \\nsequence of successive search directions d^ such that each direction is conjugate \\nto all previous directions, up to the dimensionality W of the search space. This \\nleads naturally to the conjugate gradient optimization algorithm. \\n7.7.1 Quadratic error function \\nIn order to introduce the conjugate gradient algorithm, we follow Johansson et \\nal. (1992) and consider first the case of a quadratic error function of the form \\nE(w) = E0 + bTw + |wTHw (7.51) \\nin which the parameters b and H are constant, and H is assumed to be positive \\ndefinite. The local gradient of this error function is given by \\ng(w) = b + Hw (7.52)', 'w-*igijiB;Wi^*W)»»g^»*\"\\'3J3»\\'^,iKW-y • 7.7; Conjugate gradients 277 \\nand the error function (7.51) is minimized at the point w* given, from (7.52), by \\nb + Hw* = 0. (7.53) \\nSuppose we can find a set of W vectors (where W is the dimensionality of \\nthe weight space) which are mutually conjugate with respect to H so that \\ndjHdi = 0 j^i (7.54) \\nthen it is easily shown that these vectors will be linearly independent if H is \\npositive definite (Exercise 7.8). Such vectors therefore form a complete, but non-\\northogonal, basis set in weight space. Suppose we are starting from some point \\nwi, and we wish to get to the minimum w* of the error function. The difference \\nbetween the vectors Wi and w* can be written as a linear combination of the \\nconjugate direction vectors in the form \\nw \\nW* _ Wl = Y^aidi- (7-55) \\ni=l \\nNote that, if we define \\nWj =wi + ^] oii&i (7.56) \\ni=l \\nthen (7.55) can be written as an iterative equation in the form \\nwJ+i = Wj +atjdj. (7-57)', \"This represents a succession of steps parallel the conjugate directions, with step \\nlengths controlled by the parameters otj. \\nIn order to find expressions for the a's we multiply (7.55) by djH and make \\nuse of (7.53) to give \\nw \\n-dj(b + Hwi) = ^OidjHdi.

This should \\nbe compared with Figures 7.4 and 7.7. \\nWithout this property, (7.58) would represent a set of coupled equations for the \\nat. \\nWe can write (7.59) in a more convenient form as follows. From (7.56) we \\nhave\", \"djHwj = djHwi (7.60) \\nwhere we have again used the conjugacy condition (7.54). This allows the nu\\xad\\nmerator on the right-hand side of (7.59) to be written in the form \\ndj(b + Hwj) = dj(b + HWJ) = djgj (7.61) \\nwhere gj = g(wj), and we have made use of (7.52). Thus, a, can be written in \\nthe form \\na, = -*$£-. (7.62) \\nWe now give a simple inductive argument to show that, if the weights are \\nincremented using (7.57) with the a,- given by (7.62) then the gradient vector \\ngj at the j'th step is orthogonal to all previous conjugate directions. It therefore \\nfollows that after W steps the components of the gradient along all directions \\nhave been made zero, and so we will have arrived at the minimum of the quadratic \\nform. This is illustrated schematically for a two-dimensional space in Figure 7.12. \\nTo derive the orthogonality property, we note from (7.52) that \\nSj+i - gj = H(wJ+i - wj) = atjHdj (7.63) \\nwhere we have used (7.57). We now take the scalar product of this equation with\", 'dj, and use the definition of ctj given by (7.62), to give 7.7: Conjugate gradients 279 \\ndjgj+i = 0.

(7.71) \\nWe have now developed an algorithm for finding the minimum of a general \\nquadratic error function in at most W steps. Starting from a randomly chosen \\npoint Wi, successive conjugate directions are constructed using (7.67) in which \\nthe parameters f3j are given by (7.68). At each step the weight vector is incre\\xad\\nmented along the corresponding direction using (7.57) in which the parameter \\naj is given by (7.62).', '7.7.2 The conjugate gradient algorithm \\nSo far our discussion of conjugate gradients has been limited to quadratic error \\nfunctions. For a general non-quadratic error function, the error in the neighbour\\xad\\nhood of a given point will be approximately quadratic, and so we may hope that \\nrepeated application of the above procedure will lead to effective convergence \\nto a minimum of the error. The step length in this procedure is governed by \\nthe coefficient <x, given by (7.62), and the search direction is determined by the \\ncoefficient fij given by (7.68). These expressions depend on the Hessian matrix \\nH. For a non-quadratic error function, the Hessian matrix will depend on the \\ncurrent weight vector, and so will need to be re-evaluated at each step of the \\nalgorithm. Since the evaluation of H is computationally costly for non-linear \\nneural networks, and since its evaluation would have to be done repeatedly, we', \"would like to avoid having to use the Hessian. In fact, it turns out that the co\\xad\\nefficients aj and /% can be found without explicit knowledge of H. This leads to \\nthe conjugate gradient algorithm (Hestenes and Stiefel, 1952; Press et al., 1992). \\nConsider first the coefficient f3j. If we substitute (7.63) into (7.68) we obtain \\n_gj+i(gj+i-gj) . . \\nPi~ dj(g,+1-gj.) (7-?2) \\nwhich is known as the Hestenes-Stiefel expression. From (7.66) and (7.67) we \\nhave \\ndjgj = -gjgj (7.73) \\nwhich, together with a further use of (7.66), allows (7.72) to be written in the \\nPolak-Ribiere form \\n0j = g^''ft). (7.74) \\nSj Sj \\nSimilarly, we can use the orthogonality property (7.71) for the gradients to sim\\xad\\nplify (7.74) further, resulting in the Fletcher-Reeves form 7.7: Conjugate gradients 281 \\n= g^£±i. (7.75) \\nNote that these three expressions for fij are equivalent provided the error function \\nis exactly quadratic. In practice, the error function will not be quadratic, and\", 'these different expressions for f3j can give different results. The Polak-Ribiere \\nform is generally found to give slightly better results than the other expressions. \\nThis is probably due to the fact that, if the algorithm is making little progress, \\nso that successive gradient vectors are very similar, the Polak-Ribiere form gives \\na small value for /3, so that the search direction in (7.67) tends to be reset to \\nthe negative gradient direction, which is equivalent to restarting the conjugate \\ngradient procedure. \\nWe also wish to avoid the use of the Hessian matrix to evaluate a_,. In fact, \\nin the case of a quadratic error function, the correct value of ct, can be found by \\nperforming a line minimization along the search direction. To see this, consider a \\nquadratic error (7.51) as a function of the parameter a along the search direction \\ndj, starting at the point Wj, given by \\nE{v/j + adj) = E0 + bT(wj + adj) + -(w,, + QdJ)TH(wJ + adj).

We see that the result in (7.77) is equivalent to that found in \\n(7.62). Thus, we can replace the explicit evaluation of a.} by a numerical proce\\xad\\ndure involving a line minimization along the search direction dj. \\nWe have seen that, for a quadratic error function, the conjugate gradient \\nalgorithm finds the minimum after at most W line minimizations, without cal\\xad\\nculating the Hessian matrix. This clearly represents a significant improvement \\non the simple gradient descent approach which could take a very large number of \\nsteps to minimize even a quadratic error function. In practice, the error function \\nmay be far from quadratic. The algorithm therefore generally needs to be run \\nfor many iterations until a sufficiently small error is obtained or until some other', 'termination criterion is reached. During the running of the algorithm, the conju-\\ngacy of the search directions tends to deteriorate, and so it is common practice \\nto restart the algorithm after every W steps by resetting the search vector to the \\nnegative gradient direction. More sophisticated restart procedures are described \\nin Powell (1977). \\nThe conjugate gradient algorithm has been derived on the assumption of a 282 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nquadratic error function with a positive-definite Hessian matrix. For general non\\xad\\nlinear error functions, the local Hessian matrix need not be positive definite. The \\nsearch directions defined by the conjugate gradient algorithm need not then be \\ndescent directions (Shanno, 1978). In practice, the use of robust line minimiza\\xad\\ntion techniques ensures that the error can not increase at any step, and such \\nalgorithms are generally found to have good performance in real applications.', 'As we have seen, the conjugate gradient algorithm provides a minimization \\ntechnique which requires only the evaluation of the error function and its deriva\\xad\\ntives, and which, for a quadratic error function, is guaranteed to find the mini\\xad\\nmum in at most W steps.

Set j = j + 1 and go to 3. \\nEmpirical results from the training of multi-layer perceptron networks using', 'conjugate gradients can be found in Watrous (1987), Webb et al. (1988), Kramer \\nand Sangiovanni-Vincentelli (1989), Makram-Ebeid et al. (1989), Barnard (1992) \\nand Johansson et al. (1992). \\nThe batch form of gradient descent with momentum, discussed in Section 7.5, \\ninvolves two arbitrary parameters A and /x, where A determines the step length, \\nand fi controls the momentum, i.e. the fraction of the previous step to be included \\nin the current step. A major problem with gradient descent is how to determine \\nvalues for A and n, particularly since the optimum values will typically vary \\nfrom one iteration to the next. The conjugate gradient method can be regarded \\nas a form of gradient descent with momentum, in which the parameters A and \\n/x are determined automatically at each iteration. The effective learning rate is \\ndetermined by line minimization, while the momentum is determined by the \\nparameter fy in (7.72), (7.74) or (7.75) since this controls the search direction', 'through (7.67). \\n7.8 Scaled conjugate gradients \\nWe have seen how the use of a line search allows the step size in the conjugate \\ngradient algorithm to be chosen without having to evaluate the Hessian matrix. \\nHowever, the line search itself introduces some problems. In particular, every line \\nminimization involves several error function evaluations, each of which is com\\xad\\nputationally expensive. Also, the line-search procedure itself necessarily involves 7.8: Scaled conjugate gradients 283 \\nsome parameter whose value determines the termination criterion for each line \\nsearch. The overall performance of the algorithm can be sensitive to the value \\nof this parameter since a line search which is insufficiently accurate implies that \\nthe value of ct,- is not being determined correctly, while, an excessively accurate \\nline search can represent a good deal of wasted computation. \\nM0ller (1993b) introduced the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm as a way', 'of avoiding the line-search procedure of conventional conjugate gredients. First, \\nnote that the Hessian matrix enters the formula (7.62) for ctj only in the form \\nof the Hessian multiplied by a vector dj. We saw in Section 4.10.7 that, for the \\nmulti-layer perceptron, and indeed for more general networks, the product of the \\nHessian with an arbitrary vector could be computed efficiently, in 0(W) steps \\n(per training pattern), by using central differences or, more accurately, by using \\nthe 7?.{-}-operator technique. \\nThis suggests that, instead of using line minimization, which typically in\\xad\\nvolves several error function evaluations, each of which takes 0{W) operations, \\nwe simply evaluate Hdj using the methods of Section 4.10.7. This simple ap\\xad\\nproach fails, however, because, in the case of a non-quadratic error function, the \\nHessian matrix need not be positive definite. In this case, the denominator in \\n(7.62) can become negative, and the weight update can lead to an increase in', 'the value of the error function. The problem can be overcome by modifying the \\nHessian matrix to ensure that it is positive definite. This is achieved by adding \\nto the Hessian some multiple of the unit matrix, so that the Hessian becomes \\nH + AI (7.78) \\nwhere I is the unit matrix, and A > 0 is a scaling coefficient. Provided A is \\nsufficiently large, this modified Hessian is guaranteed to be positive definite. The \\nformula for the step length is then given by \\ndTg-\\naj = ~djH,d/+A,||d,|P (7-79) \\nwhere the suffix j on Aj reflects the fact that the optimum value for this param\\xad\\neter can vary from one iteration to the next. For large values of Aj the step size \\nbecomes small. Techniques such as this are well known in standard optimization \\ntheory, where they are called model trust region methods, because the model is \\neffectively only trusted in a small region around the current search point. The \\nsize of the trust region is governed by the parameter Aj, so that for large Aj', 'the trust region is small. The model-trust-region technique is considered in more \\ndetail in the context of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm later in this chapter. \\nWe now have to find a way to choose an appropriate value for A j. From the \\ndiscussion in Section 7.7.2 we know that the expression (7.79) with Aj = 0 will \\nmove the weight vector to the minimum along the search direction provided (i) \\nthe error function can be represented by a quadratic form, and (ii) the denomi- 284 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nnator is positive (corresponding to a positive-definite Hessian). If either of these \\nconditions is not satisfied then the value of Aj needs to be increased accordingly. \\nConsider first the problem of a Hessian which is not positive definite. The \\ndenominator in the expression (7.79) for the a, can be written as \\n6j=djHjdj + Xj\\\\\\\\djf. (7.80) \\nFor a positive-definite Hessian we have 6j > 0. If, however, 6j < 0 then we can', 'increase the value of Aj in order to make 6j > 0. Let the raised value of Aj be \\ncalled Xj. Then the corresponding raised value of 6j is given by \\n^•=^ + (AJ-AJ)||dJ||2. (7.81) \\nThis will be positive if Aj > Xj - <5j/||dj||2. M0ller (1993b) chooses to set \\n*-J(A\\'-i&)- (7S2) \\nSubstituting (7.82) into (7.81) gives \\nSj = ~6j + XjUdjf = -djHj-d,- (7.83) \\nwhich is therefore now positive. This value is used as the denominator in (7.79) \\nto compute the value of the step-size parameter a,-. \\nWe now consider the effects of the local quadratic assumption. In regions \\nwhere the quadratic approximation is good, the value of Xj should be reduced, \\nwhile if the quadratic approximation is poor, Aj should be increased, so that the \\nsize of the trust region reflects the accuracy of the local quadratic approxima\\xad\\ntion. This can be achieved by considering the comparison parameter defined by \\n(Fletcher, 1987) \\nE(\\\\Vj) - E(\\\\Vj + ctjdj) \\nE(WJ) - EQ(WJ + otjdj) Aj = £\"» „*zi,ri\\\\ (7-84)', 'where EQ(W) is the local quadratic approximation to the error function in the \\nneighbourhood of the point Wj, given by \\nEQ(WJ + Qjdj) = £(Wj) + ajdjgj + ±a$djHjdj. (7.85) \\nFrom (7.84) we see that Aj gives a measure of the accuracy ol the quadratic \\napproximation. If Aj is close to 1 then the approximation is a good one and the \\nvalue of Aj can be decreased. Conversely a small value of Aj is an indication that \\nAj should be increased. Substituting (7.85) into (7.84), and using the definition \\n«*itaiS6i^«ii\" /*W\"^i* 7.9: Newton\\'s method 285 \\n(7.62) for atj, we obtain \\n= 2{E^)-Ep+a]dj)} \\nThe value of \\\\j can then be adjusted using the following prescription (Fletcher, \\n1987): \\nif Aj > 0.75 then AJ+1 = Aj/2 (7.87) \\nif Aj < 0.25 then Xj+1 = 4A-, (7.88) \\notherwise set AJ+i = Aj. Note that, if Aj < 0 so that the step would actually \\nlead to an increase in the error, then the weights are not updated, but instead \\nthe value of Aj is increased in accordance with (7.88), and Aj is re-evaluated.', \"Eventually an error decrease will be obtained since, for sufficiently large Aj, the \\nalgorithm will be taking a small step in the direction of the negative gradient. \\nThe two stages of increasing Aj (if necessary) to ensure that <5j is positive, and \\nadjusting Aj according to the validity of the local quadratic approximation, are \\napplied in succession after each weight update. \\nDetailed step-by-step descriptions of the algorithm can be found in M0ller \\n(1993b) and Williams (1991). Results from software simulations indicate that \\nthis algorithm can sometimes offer a significant improvement in speed compared \\nto conventional conjugate gradient algorithms. \\n7.9 Newton's method \\nIn the conjugate gradient algorithm, implicit use was made of second-order in\\xad\\nformation about the error surface, represented by the local Hessian matrix. We \\nnow turn to a class of algorithms which make explicit use of the Hessian. \\nUsing the local quadratic approximation, we can obtain directly an expression\", \"for the location of the minimum (or more generally the stationary point) of the \\nerror function. From (7.10) the gradient at any point w is given by \\ng = V£ = H(w - w*) (7.89) \\nand so the weight vector w* corresponding to the minimum of the error function \\nsatisfies \\nw* = w-H-1g. (7.90) \\nThe vector —H_1g is known as the Newton direction or the Newton step, and \\nforms the basis for a variety of optimization strategies. Unlike the local gradient \\nvector, the Newton direction for a quadratic error surface, evaluated at any w, \\npoints directly at the minimum of the error function, as illustrated in Figure 7.13. 286 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\n-H'g \\nFigure 7.13. Illustration of the Newton direction for a quadratic error surface. \\nThe local negative gradient vector —g(w) does not in general point towards \\nthe minimum of the error function, whereas the Newton direction —H~'g(w) \\ndoes. \\nSince the quadratic approximation used to obtain (7.90) is not exact it would\", 'be necessary to apply (7.90) iteratively, with the Hessian being re-evaluated at \\neach new search point. From (7.90), we see that the gradient descent procedure \\n(7.23) corresponds to one step of the Newton formula (7.90), with the inverse \\nHessian approximated by the unit matrix times rj, where n is the learning rate \\nparameter. \\nThere are several difficulties with such an approach, however. First, the exact \\nevaluation of the Hessian for non-linear networks is computationally demanding, \\nsince it requires 0(NW2) steps, where W is the number of weights in the net\\xad\\nwork and N is the number of patterns in the data set. This evaluation would be \\nprohibitively expensive if done at each stage of an iterative algorithm. Second, \\nthe Hessian must be inverted, which requires 0(W3) steps, and so is also com\\xad\\nputationally demanding. Third, the Newton step in (7.90) may move towards a \\nmaximum or a saddlepoint rather than a minimum. This occurs if the Hessian is', \"not positive definite, so that there exist directions of negative curvature. Thus, \\nthe error is not guaranteed to be reduced at each iteration. Finally, the step size \\npredicted by (7.90) may be sufficiently large that it takes us outside the range of \\nvalidity of the quadratic approximation. In this case the algorithm could become \\nunstable. \\nNevertheless, by making various modifications to the full Newton rule it can \\nbe turned into a practical optimization method. Note first that, if the Hessian is \\npositive definite (as is the case close to a minimum), then the Newton direction \\nalways represents a descent direction, as can be seen by considering the local \\ndirectional derivative of the error function in the Newton direction evaluated at \\nsome point w \\n= dTg = -gTET'g < 0 (7.91) \\nA=0 d\\\\ E(w + Ad) 7.10: Quasi-Newton methods 287 \\nwhere we have used the Newton step formula d = —H_1g. \\nAway from the neighbourhood of a minimum, the Hessian matrix need not\", 'be positive definite. The problem can be resolved by adopting the model trust \\nregion approach, discussed earlier in Section 7.8, and described in more detail in \\nSection 7.11. This involves adding to the Hessian a positive-definite symmetric \\nmatrix which comprises the unit matrix I times a constant factor A. Provided A \\nis sufficiently large, the new matrix \\nH + AI (7.92) \\nwill be positive definite. The corresponding step direction is a compromise be\\xad\\ntween the Newton direction and the negative gradient direction. For very small \\nvalues of A we recover the Newton direction, while for large values of A the \\ndirection approximates the negative gradient \\n_(H + AI)-1g~-ig. (7.93) \\nThis still leaves the problem of computing and inverting the Hessian matrix. \\nOne approach is to approximate the Hessian by neglecting the off-diagonal terms \\n(Becker and Le Cun, 1989; Ricotti et al, 1988). This has the advantages that the', 'inverse of the Hessian is trivial to compute, and the Newton update equations \\n(7.90) decouple into separate equations for each weight. The problem of negative \\ncurvatures is dealt with by the simple heuristic of taking the modulus of the \\nsecond derivative. This gives a Newton update for a weight w, in the form \\nAu>i ( 92E \\\\_1 \\n£ where A is treated as a small positive constant. For the multi-layer perceptron, the \\ndiagonal terms in the Hessian matrix can be computed by a back-propagation \\nprocedure as discussed in Section 4.10.1. A major drawback of this approach, \\nhowever, is that the Hessian matrix for many neural network problems is typically \\nfar from diagonal. \\n7.10 Quasi-Newton methods \\nWe have already argued that a direct application of the Newton method, as given \\nby (7.90), would be computationally prohibitive since it would require 0(NW2) \\noperations to evaluate the Hessian matrix and 0(W3) operations to compute', \"its inverse. Alternative approaches, known as quasi-Newton or variable metric \\nmethods, are based on (7.90), but instead of calculating the Hessian directly, \\nand then evaluating its inverse, they build up an approximation to the inverse \\nHessian over a number of steps. As with conjugate gradients, these methods can \\nfind the minimum of a quadratic form in at most W steps, giving an overall 288 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\ncomputational cost which is 0(NW2). \\nThe quasi-Newton approach involves generating a sequence of matrices G'r) \\nwhich represent increasingly accurate approximations to the inverse Hessian \\nH_1, using only information on the first derivatives of the error function. The \\nproblems arising from Hessian matrices which are not positive definite are solved \\nby starting from a positive-definite matrix (such as the unit matrix) and ensuring \\nthat the update procedure is such that the approximation to the inverse Hessian \\nis guaranteed to remain positive definite.\", 'From the Newton formula (7.90) we see that the weight vectors at steps r \\nand r + 1 are related to the corresponding gradients by \\nw(r+i) _ w(r) = _H-1(g(r+1) - gW) (7.95) \\nwhich is known as the quasi-Newton condition. The approximation G of the \\ninverse Hessian is constructed so as to satisfy this condition also. \\nThe two most commonly used update formulae are the Davidson-Fletcher-\\nPowell (DFP) and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) procedures. \\nHere we give only the BFGS expression, since this is generally regarded as being \\nsuperior: \\nG(r+1) = G(r) + PP! _ (G(TM^G(r) + (VTGWV)UUT (7. 96) pTv vTGWv \\nwhere we have defined the following vectors: \\np = w(r+1) - w(r) (7.97) \\nv = g(r+1> - gM (7.98) \\np GM \\nu = pTv vTG<T (7.99) \\nDerivations of this expression can be found in many standard texts on optimiza\\xad\\ntion methods such as Polak (1971), or Luenberger (1984). It is straightforward \\nto verify by direct substitution that (7.96) does indeed satisfy the quasi-Newton', 'condition (7.95). \\nInitializing the procedure using the identity matrix corresponds to taking the \\nfirst step in the direction of the negative gradient. At each step of the algorithm, \\nthe direction — Gg is guaranteed to be a descent direction, since the matrix G \\nis positive definite. However, the full Newton step given by (7.90) may take the \\nsearch outside the range of validity of the quadratic approximation. The solution \\nis to use a line-search algorithm (Section 7.6), as used with conjugate gradients, \\nto find the minimum of the error function along the search direction. Thus, the \\nweight vector is updated using 7.10: Quasi-Newton methods 289 \\nw(r+l) = w(r) + a(r)G(r)g(r) ^ 1Q0) \\nwhere a<T> is found by line minimization. \\nA significant advantage of the quasi-Newton approach over the conjugate \\ngradient method is that the line search does not need to be performed with \\nsuch great accuracy since it does not form a critical factor in the algorithm. For', 'conjugate gradients, the line minimizations need to be performed accurately in \\norder to ensure that the system of conjugate directions and orthogonal gradients \\nis set up correctly. \\nA potential disadvantage of the quasi-Newton method is that it requires the \\nstorage and update of a matrix G of size W x W. For small networks this is of \\nlittle consequence, but for networks with more than a few thousand weights it \\ncould lead to prohibitive memory requirements. In such cases, techniques such \\nas conjugate gradients, which require only 0(W) storage, have a significant ad\\xad\\nvantage. \\nFor an VF-dimensional quadratic form, the sequence of matrices G*T) is guar\\xad\\nanteed to converge exactly to the true Hessian after W steps, and the quasi-\\nNewton algorithm would find the exact minimum of the quadratic form after W \\nsteps, assuming the line minimizations were performed exactly. Results from the \\napplication of quasi-Newton methods to the training of neural networks can be', 'found in Watrous (1987), Webb et al. (1988), and Barnard (1992). \\n7.10.1 Limited memory quasi-Newton methods \\nShanno (1978) investigated the accuracy needed for line searches in both conju\\xad\\ngate gradient and quasi-Newton algorithms, and concluded that conjugate gra\\xad\\ndient algorithms require relatively accurate line searches, while quasi-Newton \\nmethods remain robust even if the line searches are only performed to relatively \\nlow accuracy. This implies that, for conjugate gradient methods, significant com\\xad\\nputational effort needs to be expended on each line minimization. \\nThe advantage of conjugate gradient algorithms, however, is that they require \\n0(W) storage rather than the 0(W2) storage needed by quasi-Newton methods. \\nThe question therefore arises as to whether we can find an algorithm which uses \\n0(W) storage but which does not require accurate line searches (Shanno, 1978). \\nOne way to reduce the storage requirement of quasi-Newton methods is to replace', \"the approximate inverse Hessian matrix G at each step by the unit matrix. If \\nwe make this substitution into the BFGS formula in (7.96), and multiply the \\nresulting approximate inverse Hessian by the current gradient g'T+1\\\\ we obtain \\nthe following expression for the search direction \\nd<T+x) = -g(T+1) + Ap + Bv (7.101) \\nwhere the scalars A and B are defined by 290 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\nVT_(T+1) vT.(r+l) \\n1 + ^)*^ + ^- (T.102) pTv pTv \\nDTE(r+l) \\nB = i—% (7.103) \\nand the vectors p and v are defined in (7.97) and (7.98). If exact line searches are \\nperformed, then (7.101) produces search directions which are mutually conjugate \\n(Shanno, 1978). The difference compared with standard conjugate gradients is \\nthat if approximate line searches are used, the algorithm remains well behaved. \\nAs with conjugate gradients, the algorithm is restarted in the direction of the \\nnegative gradient every W steps. This is known as the limited memory BFGS\", 'algorithm, and has been applied to the problem of neural network training by \\nBattiti (1989). \\n7.11 The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm \\nMany of the optimization algorithms we have discussed up to now have been \\ngeneral-purpose methods designed to work with a wide range of error functions. \\nWe now describe an algorithm designed specifically for minimizing a sum-of-\\nsquares error. \\nConsider the sum-of-squares error function in the form \\n£=^]>>n)2=4NI2 (7.104) \\nwhere en is the error for the ?ith pattern, and e is a vector with elements en. \\nSuppose we are currently at a point w0id in weight space and we move to a point \\nwnew.

We therefore see that (7.108) involves the \\ninverse Hessian, as we might expect since it corresponds to the Newton step \\napplied to the linearized model in (7.105). For non-linear networks it represents \\nan approximation, although we note that in the limit of an infinite data set', 'the expression (7.110) is exact at the global minimum of the error function, \\nas discussed in Section 6.1.4. Recall that in this approximation the Hessian is \\nrelatively easy to compute, since first derivatives with respect to network weights \\ncan be obtained very efficiently using back-propagation as shown in Section 4.8.3. \\nIn principle, the update formula (7.108) could be applied iteratively in order \\nto try to minimize the error function. The problem with such an approach is that \\nthe step size which is given by (7.108) could turn out to be relatively large, in \\nwhich case the linear approximation (7.107) on which it is based would no longer \\nbe valid. In the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, \\n1963), this problem is addressed by seeking to minimize the error function while \\nat the same time trying to keep the step size small so as to ensure that the linear \\napproximation remains valid. This is achieved by considering a modified error \\nfunction of the form', 'E = g ll6(Wold) + Z(wnew - Wold)||2 + A||wnew - Wo!d||2 (7.111) \\nwhere the parameter A governs the step size. For large values of A the value of \\n||wnew — w0id||2 will tend to be small. If we minimize the modified error (7.111) \\nwith respect to wnew, we obtain \\nwnew = wold - (ZTZ + AI)-1ZT€(wold) (7.112) \\nwhere I is the unit matrix. For very small values of the parameter A we recover \\nthe Newton formula, while for large values of A we recover standard gradient 292 7: Parameter Optimization Algorithms \\ndescent. In this latter case the step length is determined by A-1, so that it is \\nclear that, for sufficiently large values of A, the error will necessarily decrease \\nsince (7.112) then generates a very small step in the direction of the negative \\ngradient. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an example of a model trust \\nregion approach in which the model (in this case the linearized approximation \\nfor the error function) is trusted only within some region around the current', 'search point. The size of this region is governed by the value of A. \\nIn practice a value must be chosen for A and this value should vary appropri\\xad\\nately during the minimization process. One common approach for setting A is to \\nbegin with some arbitrary value such as A = 0.1, and at each step monitor the \\nchange in error E. If the error decreases after taking the step predicted by (7.112) \\nthe new weight vector is retained, the value of A is decreased by a factor of 10, \\nand the process repeated. If, however, the error increases, then A is increased \\nby a factor of 10, the old weight vector is restored, and a new weight update \\ncomputed. This is repeated until a decrease in E is obtained. Comparisons of \\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with other methods for training multi-layer \\nperceptrons are given in Webb et al. (1988). \\nExercises \\n7.1 (*) Show that the stationary point w* of quadratic error surface of the form', '(7.10) is a unique global minimum if, and only if, the Hessian matrix is \\npositive definite, so that all of its eigenvalues are positive. \\n7.2 (* *) Consider a quadratic error error function in two-dimensions of the form \\nE=±\\\\iwl + ±\\\\iwl (7.113) \\nVerify that Aj and A2 are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix.

For most \\napplications it is necessary first to transform the data into some new represen\\xad\\ntation before training a neural network. To some extent, the general-purpose \\nnature of a neural network mapping means that less emphasis has to be placed \\non careful optimization of this pre-processing than would be the case with simple \\nlinear techniques, for instance. Nevertheless, in many practical applications the', 'choice of pre-processing will be one of the most significant factors in determining \\nthe performance of the final system. \\nIn the simplest case, pre-processing may take the form of a linear transforma\\xad\\ntion of the input data, and possibly also of the output data (where it is sometimes \\ntermed post-processing). More complex pre-processing may involve reduction of \\nthe dimensionality of the input data. The fact that such dimensionality reduction \\ncan lead to improved performance may at first appear somewhat paradoxical, \\nsince it cannot increase the information content of the input data, and in most \\ncases will reduce it. The resolution is related to the curse of dimensionality dis\\xad\\ncussed in Section 1.4. \\nAnother important way in which network performance can be improved, \\nsometimes dramatically, is through the incorporation of prior knowledge, which \\nrefers to relevant information which might be used to develop a solution and', \"which is additional to that provided by the training data. Prior knowledge can \\neither be incorporated into the network structure itself or into the pre-processing \\nand post-processing stages. It can also be used to modify the training process \\nthrough the use of regularization, as discussed in Sections 9.2 and 10.1.2. \\nA final aspect of data preparation arises from the fact that real data often \\nsuffers from a number of deficiencies such as missing input values or incorrect \\ntarget values. \\nIn this chapter we shall focus primarily on classification problems. It should \\nbe emphasized, however, that most of the same general principles apply equally \\nto regression problems. 296 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\noutput \\ndata \\npost\\xad\\nprocessing \\n~^~ \\nneural \\nnetwork \\npre\\xad\\nprocessing \\ninput I \\ndata ' \\nFigure 8.1. Schematic illustration of the use of data pre-processing and post\\xad\\nprocessing in conjunction with a neural network mapping. \\n8.1 Pre-processing and post-processing\", 'In Chapter 1 we formulated the problem of pattern recognition in terms of a \\nnon-linear mapping from a set of input variables to a set of output variables. We \\nhave already seen that a feed-forward neural network can in principle represent an \\narbitrary functional mapping between spaces of many dimensions, and so it would \\nappear that we could use a single network to map the raw input data directly \\nonto the required output variables. In practice it is nearly always advantageous \\nto apply pre-processing transformations to the input data before it is presented \\nto a network. Similarly, the outputs of the network are often post-processed to \\ngive the required output values. These steps are indicated in Figure 8.1. The pre\\xad\\nprocessing and post-processing steps may consist of simple fixed transformations \\ndetermined by hand, or they may themselves involve some adaptive processes \\nwhich are driven by the data. For practical applications, data pre-processing is', 'often one of the most important stages in the development of solution, and the \\nchoice of pre-processing steps can often have a significant effect on generalization \\nperformance. \\nSince the training of the neural network may involve an iterative algorithm, \\nit will generally be convenient to process the whole training set using the pre\\xad\\nprocessing transformations, and then use this transformed data set to train the \\nnetwork. With applications involving on-line learning, each new data point must \\nfirst be pre-processed before it is passed to the network. If post-processing of \\nthe network outputs is used, then the target data must be transformed using \\nthe inverse of the post-processing transformation in order to generate the target \\nvalues for the network outputs. When subsequent data is processed by the trained \\nnetwork, it must first be passed through the pre-processing stage, then through', 'the network, and finally through the post-processing transformation. 8.1: Pre-processing and post-processing 297 \\nOne of the most important forms of pre-processing involves a reduction in \\nthe dimensionality of the input data. At the simplest level this could involve \\ndiscarding a subset of the original inputs. Other approaches involve forming \\nlinear or non-linear combinations of the original variables to generate inputs for \\nthe network. Such combinations of inputs are sometimes called features, and the \\nprocess of generating them is called feature extraction. The principal motivation \\nfor dimensionality reduction is that it can help to alleviate the worst effects \\nof the curse of dimensionality (Section 1.4). A network with fewer inputs has \\nfewer adaptive parameters to be determined, and these are more likely to be \\nproperly constrained by a data set of limited size, leading to a network with \\nbetter generalization properties. In addition, a network with fewer weights may', 'be faster to train. \\nAs a rather extreme example, consider the hypothetical character recognition \\nproblem discussed in Section 1.1. A 256 x 256 image has a total of 65 536 pixels. \\nIn the most direct approach we could take each pixel as the input to a single large \\nneural network, which would give 65537 adaptive weights (including the bias) \\nfor every unit in the first hidden layer. This implies that a very large training \\nset would be needed to ensure that the weights were well determined, and this \\nin turn implies that huge computational resources would be needed in order to \\nfind a suitable minimum of the error function. In practice such an approach is \\nclearly impractical. One technique for dimensionality reduction in this case is \\npixel averaging which involves grouping blocks of pixels together and replacing \\neach of them with a single effective pixel whose grey-scale value is given by the \\naverage of the grey-scale values of the original pixels in the block. It is clear that', 'information is discarded by this process, and that if the blocks of pixels are too \\nlarge, then there will be insufficient information remaining in the pixel averaged \\nimage for effective classification. These averaged pixels are examples of features, \\nthat is modified inputs formed from collections of the original inputs which might \\nbe combined in linear or non-linear ways. For an image interpretation problem \\nit will often be possible to identify more appropriate features which retain more \\nof the relevant information in the original image. For a medical classification \\nproblem, such features might include various measures of textures, while for a \\nproblem involving detecting objects in images, it might be more appropriate to \\nextract features involving geometrical parameters such as the lengths of edges \\nor the areas of contiguous regions. \\nClearly in most situations a reduction in the dimensionality of the input vec\\xad', 'tor wili result in loss of information. One of the main goals in designing a good \\npre-processing strategy is to ensure that as much of the relevant information as \\npossible is retained. If too much information is lost in the pre-processing stage \\nthen the resulting reduction in performance more than offsets any improvement \\narising from a reduction in dimensionality. Consider a classification problem in \\nwhich an input vector x is to be assigned to one of c classes C^ where k = 1,..., c. \\nThe minimum probability of misclassification is obtained by assigning each input \\nvector x to the class 0% having the largest posterior probability P(Ck\\\\x). We can \\nregard these probabilities as examples of features. Since there are c such features, 298 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nand since they satisfy the relation J2k -P(£fclx) — *i we see that in principle c— 1 \\nindependent features are sufficient to give the optimal classifier. In practice, of', 'course, we will not be able to obtain these probabilities easily, otherwise we would \\nalready have solved the problem. We may therefore need to retain a much larger \\nnumber of features in order to ensure that we do not discard too much useful in\\xad\\nformation. This discussion highlights the rather artificial distinction between the \\npre-processing stage and the classification or regression stage. If we can perform \\nsufficiently clever pre-processing then the remaining operations become trivial. \\nClearly there is a balance to be found in the extent to which data processing is \\nperformed in the pre-processing and post-processing stages, and the extent to \\nwhich it is performed by the network itself. \\n8.2 Input normalization and encoding \\nOne of the most common forms of pre-processing consists of a simple linear \\nrescaling of the input variables. This is often useful if different variables have \\ntypical values which differ significantly. In a system monitoring a chemical plant,', 'for instance, two of the inputs might represent a temperature and a pressure \\nrespectively. Depending on the units in which each of these is expressed, they \\nmay have values which differ by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the \\ntypical sizes of the inputs may not reflect their relative importance in determining \\nthe required outputs. \\nBy applying a linear transformation we can arrange for all of the inputs to \\nhave similar values. To do this, we treat each of the input variables independently, \\nand for each variable Xi we calculate its mean x, and variance of with respect \\nto the training set, using \\n1 N \\nXi = ]v ^ X^ \\nn=l \\nn=l \\nwhere n — 1,..., TV labels the patterns. We then define a set of re-scaled variables \\ngiven by \\nx» = *Ll*i. (8.2) \\nIt is easy to see that the transformed variables given by the xf have zero mean \\nand unit standard deviation over the transformed training set. In the case of', 'regression problems it is often appropriate to apply a similar linear rescaling to \\nthe target values. 8.2: Input normalization and encoding 299 \\nNote that the transformation in (8.2) is linear and so, for the case of a multi\\xad\\nlayer perceptron, it is in principle redundant since it could be combined with \\nthe linear transformation in the first layer of the network. In practice, however, \\ninput normalization ensures that all of the input and target variables are of order \\nunity, in which case we expect that the network weights should also be of order \\nunity. The weights can then be given a suitable random initialization prior to \\nnetwork training. Without the linear rescaling, we would need to find a solution \\nfor the weights in which some weight values had markedly different values from \\nothers. \\nNote that, in the case of a radial basis function network with spherically-\\nsymmetric basis functions, it is particularly important to normalize the input', 'variables so that they span similar ranges. This is a consequence of the fact \\nthat the activation of a basis function is determined by the Euclidean distance I \\nbetween the input vector x and the basis function centre fij given by \\n<2 = ||x-^||2 = f;{x«-W4}2 (8.3) i=l \\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the input space. If one of the input variables \\nhas a much smaller range of values than the others, the value of I2 will be very \\ninsensitive to this variable. In principle, an alternative to normalization of the \\ninput data is to use basis functions with more general covariance matrices. \\nThe simple linear rescaling in (8.2) treats the variables as independent. We \\ncan perform a more sophisticated linear rescaling, known as whitening, which \\nallows also for correlations amongst the variables (Pukunaga, 1990). For conve\\xad\\nnience we group the input variables Xi into a vector x = (xi,..., Xd)T, which has \\nsample mean vector and covariance matrix with respect to the N data points of', 'the training set given by \\n1 N \\nn=l \\nE=AFZlI>n-S)(xn-X)T <8\\'4) n=l \\nIf we introduce the eigenvalue equation for the covariance matrix \\nSuj- = XjUj (8.5) \\nthen we can define a vector of linearly transformed input variables given by \\n5\" = A-1/2UT(xn-x) (8.6) 300 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nwhitened \\ndistribution \\noriginal \\ndistribution \\n• \\nFigure 8.2. Schematic illustration of the use of the eigenvectors Uj (together \\nwith their corresponding eigenvalues Xj) of the covariance matrix of a distri\\xad\\nbution to whiten the distribution so that its covariance matrix becomes the \\nunit matrix. \\nwhere we have defined \\nA = diag(A1,...,Ad). (8.7) \\n(8.8) \\nThen it is easy to verify that, in the transformed coordinates, the data set has \\nzero mean and a covariance matrix which is given by the unit matrix. This is \\nillustrated schematically in Figure 8.2. \\n8.2.1 Discrete data \\nSo far we have discussed data which takes the form of continuous variables. We', \"may also have to deal with data taking on discrete values. In such cases it is con\\xad\\nvenient to distinguish between ordinal variables which have a natural ordering, \\nand categorical variables which do not. An example of an ordinal variable would \\nbe a person's age in years. Such data can simply be transformed directly into \\nthe corresponding values of a continuous variable. An example of a categorical \\nvariable would be a measurement which could take one of the values red, green \\nor blue. If these were to be represented as, for instance, the values 0.0, 0.5 and \\n1.0 of a single continuous input variable, this would impose an artificial ordering \\non the data. One way around this is to use a 1-of-c coding for the input data, \\nsimilar to that discussed for target data in classification problems in Section 6.6. \\nIn the above example this requires three input variables, with the three colours \\nrepresented by input values of (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). 8.3: Missing data 301\", '8.3 Missing data \\nIn practical applications it sometimes happens that the data suffers from defi\\xad\\nciencies which should be remedied before the data is used for network training. \\nA common problem is that some of the input values may be missing from the \\ndata set for some of the pattern vectors (Little and Rubin, 1987; Little, 1992). If \\nthe quantity of data available is sufficiently large, and the proportion of patterns \\naffected is small, then the simplest solution is to discard those patterns from \\nthe data set. Note that this approach is implicitly assuming that the mechanism \\nwhich is responsible for the omission of data values is independent of the data \\nitself. If the values which are missing depend on the data, then this approach \\nwill modify the effective data distribution. An example would be a sensor which \\nalways fails to produce an output signal when the signal value exceeds some \\nthreshold. \\nWhen there is too little data to discard the deficient examples, or when the', 'proportion of deficient points is too high, it becomes important to make full use \\nof the information which is potentially available from the incomplete patterns. \\nConsider first the problem of unconditional density estimation, for the case of a \\nparametric model based on a single Gaussian distribution. A common heuristic \\nfor estimating the model parameters would be the following. The components \\\\ii \\nof the mean vector y, are estimated from the values of Xi for all of the data points \\nfor which this value is available, irrespective of whether other input values are \\npresent. Similarly, the (i, j) element of the covariance matrix £ is found using \\nall pairs of data points for which values of both Xj and xj are available. Such an \\napproach, however, can lead to poor results (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994b), \\nas indicated in Figure 8.3. \\nVarious heuristics have also been proposed for dealing with missing input', \"data in regression and classification problems. For example, it is common to 'fill \\nin' the missing input values first (Hand, 1981), and then train a feed-forward \\nnetwork using some standard method. For example, each missing value might \\nbe replaced by the mean of the corresponding variable over those patterns for \\nwhich its value is available. This is prone to serious problems as discussed above. \\nA more elaborate approach is to express any variable which has missing values in \\nterms of a regression over the other variables using the available data, and then \\nto use the regression function to fill in the missing values. Again, this approach \\ntends to cause problems as it underestimates the covariance in the data since \\nthe regression function is noise-free. \\nMissing data in density estimation problems can be dealt with in a princi\\xad\\npled way by seeking a maximum likelihood solution, and using the expectation-\", \"maximization, or EM, algorithm to deal with missing data. In Section 2.6.2, the \\nEM algorithm was introduced as a technique for finding maximum likelihood \\nsolutions for mixture models, in which hypothetical variables describing which \\ncomponent was responsible for generating each data point were introduced and \\ntreated as 'missing data'. The EM algorithm can similarly be applied to the prob\\xad\\nlem of variables missing from the data itself (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994b). 302 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nFigure 8.3. Schematic illustration of a set of data points in two dimensions. \\nFor some of the data points (shown by the crosses) the values of both variables \\nare present, while for others (shown by the vertical lines) only the values of \\nx\\\\ are known. If the mean vector of the distribution is estimated using the \\navailable values of each variable separately, then the result is a poor estimate, \\nas indicated by the square.\", \"In fact the two problems can be tackled together, so that the parameters of a \\nmixture model can be estimated, even when there is missing data. Such tech\\xad\\nniques can be applied to the determination of the basis function parameters in \\na radial basis function network, as discussed in Section 5.9.4. They can also be \\nused to determine the density p(x, t) in the joint input-target space. From this \\ndensity, the conditional density p(t\\\\x) can be evaluated, as can the regression \\nfunction (t|x). \\nIn general, missing values should be treated by integration over the cor\\xad\\nresponding variables (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993), weighted by the appropriate \\ndistribution (Exercise 8.4). This requires that the input distribution itself be \\nmodelled. A related approach is to fill in the missing data points with values \\ndrawn at random from this distribution (Lowe and Webb, 1990). It is then pos\\xad\\nsible to generate many different 'completions' of a given input pattern which has\", 'missing variables. This can be regarded as a simple Monte Carlo approximation \\nto the required integration over the input distribution (Section 10.9). \\n8.4 Time series prediction \\nMany potential applications of neural networks involve data x = x(r) which \\nvaries as a function of time r. The goal is often to predict the value of x a short \\ntime into the future. Techniques based on feed-forward networks, of the kind \\ndescribed in earlier chapters, can be applied directly to such problems provided \\nthe data is appropriately pre-processed first. Consider for simplicity a single \\nvariable x(r). One common approach is to sample X(T) at regular intervals to \\ngenerate a series of discrete values xT^i,xT,xT+i and so on. We can take a set 8.4: Time series prediction 303 \\nt t t • \\nXx-2 Xz-1 Xl Xx+l \\nFigure 8.4. Sampling of a time series at discrete steps can be used to generate \\na set of training data for a feed-forward network. Successive values of the', \"time-dependent variable X(T), given by xr^d+i,- • • ,xr, form the inputs to a \\nfeed-forward network, and the corresponding target value is given by xT+i . \\nof d such values xT_d+i,... ,xT to be the inputs to a feed-forward network, and \\nuse the next value xT+i as the target for the output of the network, as indicated \\nin Figure 8.4. By stepping along the time axis, we can create a training data set \\nconsisting of many sets of input values with corresponding target values. Once \\nthe network has been trained, it can be presented with a set of observed values \\nxT'_d+ii • •., av and used to make a prediction for av+i- This is called one step \\nahead prediction. If the predictions themselves are cycled around to the inputs \\nof the network, then predictions can be made at further points av+2 ar*d so on. \\nThis is called multi-step ahead prediction, and is typically characterized by a \\nrapidly increasing divergence between the predicted and observed values as the\", 'number of steps ahead is increased due to the accumulation of errors. The above \\napproach is easily generalized to deal with several time-dependent variables in \\nthe form of a time-dependent vector x(r). \\nOne drawback with this technique is the need to choose the time increment \\nbetween successive inputs, and this may require some empirical optimization. \\nAnother problem is that the time series may show an underlying trend, such as \\na steadily increasing value, with more complex structure superimposed. This can \\nbe removed by fitting a simple (e.g. linear) function of time to the data, and then \\nsubtracting off the predictions of this simple model. Such pre-processing is called \\nde-trending, and without it, a trained network would be forced to extrapolate \\nwhen presented with new data, and would therefore have poor performance. \\nThere is a key assumption which is implicit in this approach to time series', \"prediction, which is that the statistical properties of the generator of the data \\n(after de-trending) are time-independent. Provided this is the case, then the pre\\xad\\nprocessing described above has mapped the time series problem onto a static \\nfunction approximation problem, to which a feed-forward network can be applied. 304 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nIf, however, the generator of the data itself evolves with time, then this approach \\nis inappropriate and it becomes necessary for the network model to adapt to the \\ndata continuously so that it can 'track' the time variation. This requires on-line \\nlearning techniques, and raises a number of important issues, many of which are \\nat present largely unresolved and lie outside the scope of this book. \\n8.5 Feature selection \\nOne of the simplest techniques for dimensionality reduction is to select a subset \\nof the inputs, and to discard the remainder. This approach can be useful if\", 'there are inputs which carry little useful information for the solution of the \\nproblem, or if there are very strong correlations between sets of inputs so that \\nthe same information is repeated in several variables. It can be applied not only \\nto the original data, but also to a set of candidate features constructed by some \\nother means. For convenience we shall talk of feature selection, even though the \\nfeatures might simply be the original input variables. Many of the ideas are \\nequally applicable to conventional approaches to pattern recognition, and are \\ncovered in a number of the standard books in this area including Hand (1981), \\nDevijver and Kittler (1982) and Fukunaga (1990), and are reviewed in Siedlecki \\nand Sklansky (1988). \\nAny procedure for feature selection must be based on two components. First, \\na criterion must be defined by which it is possible to judge whether one subset of \\nfeatures is better than another. Second, a systematic procedure must be found', 'for searching through candidate subsets of features. In principle the selection \\ncriterion should be the same as will be used to assess the complete system (such \\nas misclassification rate for a classification problem or sum-of-squares error for \\na regression problem). Similarly, the search procedure could simply consist of \\nan exhaustive search of all possible subsets of features since this is in general \\nthe only approach which is guaranteed to find the optimal subset. In a practical \\napplication, however, we are often forced to consider simplified selection criteria \\nas well as non-exhaustive search procedures in order to limit the computational \\ncomplexity of the search process. We begin with a discussion of possible selection \\ncriteria. \\n8.5.1 Selection criteria \\nIt is clear that the optimal subset of features selected from a given starting set \\nwill depend, among other things, on the particular form of model (neural network', 'or otherwise) with which they are to be used. Ideally the selection criterion would \\nbe obtained by training the network on the given subset of features, and then \\nevaluating its performance on an independent set of test data. If the network \\ntraining procedure involves non-linear optimization, such an approach is likely \\nto be impractical since the training and testing process would have to be repeated \\nfor each new choice of feature subset, and the computational requirements would \\nbecome too great. It is therefore common to use a simpler model, such as a linear \\nmapping, in order to select the features, and then use these features with the \\nmore sophisticated non-linear model. The simplified model is chosen so that it can 8.5: Feature selection 305 \\nbe trained relatively quickly (using linear matrix methods for instance) thereby \\npermitting a relatively large number of feature combinations to be explored. It', 'should be emphasized, however, that the feature selection and the classification \\n(or regression) stages should be ideally be optimized together, and that it is \\nonly because of practical constraints that we are often forced to treat them \\nindependently. \\nFor regression problems, we can take the simple model to be a linear mapping \\ngiven by a single-layer network with linear output units, which is equivalent to \\nmatrix multiplication with the addition of a bias vector. If the error function \\nfor network training is given by a sum-of-squares, we can use this same mea\\xad\\nsure for feature selection. In this case, the optimal values for the weights and \\nbiases in the linear mapping can be expressed in terms of a set of linear equa\\xad\\ntions whose solution can be found quickly by using singular value decomposition \\n(Section 3.4.3). \\nFor classification problems, the selection criterion should ideally be taken to \\nbe the probability of misclassification, or more generally as the expected total', 'loss or risk. This could in principle be calculated by using either parametric or \\nnon-parametric techniques to estimate the posterior probabilities for each class \\n(Hand, 1981). In practice, evaluation of this criterion directly is generally too \\ncomplex, and we have to resort instead to simpler criteria such as those based \\non class separability. We expect that a set of variables in which the classes are \\nbest separated will be a good set of variables for input to a neural network or \\nother classifier. Appropriate criteria for class separability, based on covariance \\nmatrices, were discussed in Section 3.6 in the context of the Fisher discriminant \\nand its generalizations. \\nIf we were able to use the full criterion of misclassification rate, we would \\nexpect that, as we reduce the number of features which are retained, the gener\\xad\\nalization performance of the system would improve (a consequence of the curse', 'of dimensionality) until some optimal subset of features is reached, and that if \\nfewer features are retained the performance will degrade. One of the limitations \\nof many simple selection criteria, such as those based on class separability, is \\nthat they are incapable of modelling this phenomenon. For example, the Maha-\\nlanobis distance A2 (Section 2.1.1) always increases as extra variables are added. \\nIn general such measures J satisfy a monotonicity property such that \\nJ(X+) > J{X) (8.9) \\nwhere X denotes a set of features, and X+ denotes a larger set of features which \\ncontains the set X as a subset. This property is shared by criteria based on \\ncovariance matrices. The inequality simply says that deleting features cannot \\nreduce the error rate. As a consequence, criteria which satisfy the monotonicity \\nconstraint cannot be used to determine the optimum size for a set of variables \\nand so cannot be used to compare sets of different sizes. However, they do offer a', 'useful way to compare sets of variables having the same number of elements. In 306 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\npractice the removal of features can improve the error rate when we take account \\nof the effects of a finite size data set. One approach to the set size problem is to \\nuse conventional statistical tests to measure the significance of the improvement \\nin discrimination resulting from inclusion of extra variables (Hand, 1981). An\\xad\\nother approach is to apply cross-validation techniques (Section 9.8.1) to compare \\nmodels trained using different numbers of features, where the particular feature \\nsubset used for each model is determined by one of the approaches discussed \\nhere. \\n8.5.2 Search procedures \\nIf we have a total of d possible features, then since each feature can be present \\nor absent, there are a total of 2d possible feature subsets which could be consid\\xad\\nered. For a relatively small number of features we might consider simply using', 'exhaustive search. With 10 input variables, for example, there are 1024 possible \\nsubsets which it might be computationally feasible to consider. For large numbers \\nof input variables, however, exhaustive search becomes prohibitively expensive. \\nThus with 100 inputs there are over 1030 possible subsets, and exhaustive search \\nis impossible. If we have already decided that we want to extract precisely d \\nfeatures then the number of combinations of features is given by \\n(8.10) \\n(d - d)\\\\d\\\\ \\nwhich can be significantly smaller than 2d, but which may still be impractically \\nlarge in many applications. \\nIn principle it may be necessary to consider all possible subsets of features, \\nsince combinations of variables can provide significant information which is not \\navailable in any of the individual variables separately. This is illustrated for two \\nclasses, and two features xi and X2, in Figure 8.5. Either feature taken alone gives', 'strong overlap between the two classes, while if the two features are considered \\ntogether then the classes form well-separated clusters. A similar effect can occur \\nwith an arbitrary number of features so that, in the most general case, the only \\nway to find the optimum subset is to perform exhaustive search. \\nIf we are using a criterion which satisfies the monotonicity relation in (8.9) \\nthen there exists an accelerated search procedure known as branch and bound \\n(Narendra and Fukunaga, 1977). This method can also be applied in many other \\nareas such as cluster analysis and searching for nearest neighbours. In the present \\ncontext it will guarantee to find the best subset of given size, without needing \\nto evaluate all possible subsets. To understand this technique, we begin by dis\\xad\\ncussing the exhaustive search procedure, which we set out as a tree structure. \\nConsider an original set of d features Xi where i = 1,..., rf, and denote the', \"indices of the M = d — d features which have been discarded by ZI,...,ZM, \\nwhere each z* can take the value 1,... ,d. However, no two Zk should take the \\nsame value, since that would represent a single feature being eliminated twice. 8.5: Feature selection 307 \\n* o \\nxx o o \\n°o * x \\nO x X \\n• \\nx, \\nFigure 8.5. Example of data from two classes (represented by the crosses and \\nthe circles respectively) as described by two feature variables xi and xi. If the \\ndata was described by either feature alone then there would be strong overlap \\nof the two classes, while with if both features are used, as shown here, then \\nthe classes are well separated. \\nAlso, the order of the Zfc's is irrelevant in defining the feature subset. A sufficient \\ncondition for satisfying these constraints is that the Zk should satisfy \\nzi < z2 < ... <ZM- (8.11) \\nThis allows us to construct a search tree, as shown in Figure 8.6 for the case of\", 'five original features from which we wish to select a subset of two. The features \\nare indexed by the labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the number next to each node denotes \\nthe feature which is eliminated at that node. Each possible subset of two features \\nselected from a total of five is represented by one of the nodes at the bottom of \\nthe tree. At the first level down from the top of the tree, the highest value of Zk \\nwhich is considered is 3, since any higher value would not allow the constraint \\n(8.11) to be satisfied. Similar arguments are used to construct the rest of the \\ntree. Now suppose that we wish to maximize a criterion J(d) and that the value \\nof J corresponding to the node shown at A is recorded as a threshold. If at any \\npoint in the search an intermediate node is encountered, such as that shown \\nat B, for which the value of J is smaller than the threshold, then there is no \\nneed to evaluate any of the sets which lie below this node on the tree, since,', \"as a consequence of the monotonicity relation (8.9), such nodes necessarily have \\nvalues of the criterion which are smaller than the threshold. Thus, the nodes \\nshown as solid circles in Figure 8.6 need not be evaluated. If at any point in the \\nsearch a final-layer node is encountered which has a larger value for the criterion, \\nthen this value becomes the new threshold. The algorithm terminates when every \\nfinal-layer node has either been evaluated or excluded using the monotonicity^ \\nrelation. Note that, unlike exhaustive search applied to all possible subsets of d \\nvariables, this method requires evaluation of some of the intermediate sub-sots \\n'rt 308 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nFigure 8.6. A search tree for feature subset selection, for the case of a set of \\nfive feature variables from which we wish to pick out the optimum subset of \\ntwo variables. If a strictly monotonic selection criterion is being used, and a\", 'node such as that at B is found which has a lower value for the criterion than \\nsome final-level node such as that at A, then all nodes below B (shown as solid \\nblack nodes) can be eliminated from the search. \\nwhich contain more than d variables. However, this is more than offset by the \\nsavings in not having to evaluate final-layer subsets which are excluded using the \\nmonotonicity property. The basic branch and bound algorithm can be modified \\nto generate a tree in which nodes with smaller values of the selection criterion \\ntend to have larger numbers of successive branches (Fukunaga, 1990). This can \\nlead to improvements in computational efficiency since nodes with smaller values \\nof the criterion are more likely to be eliminated from the search tree. \\n8.5.3 Sequential search techniques \\nThe branch and bound algorithm for monotonic selection criteria is generally \\nfaster than exhaustive search but is still guaranteed to find the feature sub\\xad', 'set (of given size) which maximizes the criterion. In some applications, such an \\napproach is still computationally too expensive, and we are then forced to con\\xad\\nsider techniques which are significantly faster but which may give suboptimal \\nsolutions. The simplest method would be to select those d features which are \\nindividually the best (obtained by evaluating the selection criterion using one \\nfeature at a time). This method, however, is likely to be highly unreliable, and \\nwould only be optimal for selection criteria which can be expressed as the sum, or \\nthe product, of the criterion evaluated for each feature individually, and it would \\ntherefore only be appropriate if the features were completely independent. \\nA better approach, known as sequential forward selection, is illustrated in \\nFigure 8.7. The procedure begins by considering each of the variables individually \\nand selecting the one which gives the largest value for the selection criterion. At', 'each successive stage of the algorithm, one additional feature is added to the set, 8.5: Feature selection 309 \\n(1) (2) (3) (4) \\n(13) (23) (34) \\nA (123) (234) \\nFigure 8.7. Sequential forward selection illustrated for a set of four input fea\\xad\\ntures, denoted by 1, 2, 3 and 4. The single best feature variable is chosen first, \\nand then features are added one at a time such that at each stage the variable \\nchosen is the one which produces the greatest increase in the criterion function. \\nagain chosen on the basis of which of the possible candidates at that stage gives \\nrise to the largest increase in the value of the selection criterion. One obvious \\ndifficulty with this approach is that, if there are two feature variables of the kind \\nshown in Figure 8.5, such that either feature alone provides little discrimination, \\nbut where both features together are very effective, then the forward selection \\nprocedure may never find this combination since either feature alone would never', 'be selected. \\nAn alternative is to start with the full set of d features and to eliminate them \\none at a time. This gives rise to the technique of sequential backward elimination \\nillustrated in Figure 8.8. At each stage of the algorithm, one feature is deleted \\nfrom the set, chosen from amongst all available candidates as the one which gives \\nthe smallest reduction in the value of the selection criterion. This overcomes the \\nproblem with the forward selection approach highlighted above, but is still not \\nguaranteed to be optimal. The backward elimination algorithm requires a greater \\nnumber of evaluations, however, since it considers numbers of features greater \\nthan or equal to d while the forward selection procedure considers numbers of \\nfeatures less than or equal to d. \\nThese algorithms can be generalized in various ways in order to allow small \\nsubsets of features which are collectively useful to be selected (Devijver and', 'Kittler, 1982). For example, at the kth stage of the algorithm, we can add I \\nfeatures using the sequential forward algorithm and then eliminate r features \\nusing the sequential backwards algorithm. Clearly there are many variations on \\nthis theme giving a range of algorithms which search a larger range of feature \\nsubsets at the price of increased computation. 310 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\n(1234) \\n(234) (134) (124) (123) \\nA\\\\ (24) (14) (12) \\nFigure 8.8.

Starting with the complete set, features are eliminated \\none at a time, such that at each stage the feature chosen for elimination is \\nthe one corresponding to the smallest reduction in the value of the selection \\ncriterion. \\n8.6 Principal component analysis \\nWe have already discussed the problems which can arise in attempts to perform \\npattern recognition in high-dimensional spaces, and the potential improvements', 'which can be achieved by first mapping the data into a space of lower dimen\\xad\\nsionality. In general, a reduction in the dimensionality of the input space will be \\naccompanied by a loss of some of the information which discriminates between \\ndifferent classes (or, more generally, which determines the target values). The \\ngoal in dimensionality reduction is therefore to preserve as much of the relevant \\ninformation as possible. We have already discussed one approach to dimension\\xad\\nality reduction based on the selection of a subset of a given set of features or \\ninputs. Here we consider techniques for combining inputs together to make a \\n(generally smaller) set of features. The procedures we shall discuss in this sec\\xad\\ntion rely entirely on the input data itself without reference to the corresponding \\ntarget data, and can be regarded as a form of unsupervised learning. While they \\nare of great practical significance, the neglect of the target data information', \"implies they can also be significantly sub-optimal, as we discuss in Section 8.6.3. \\nWe begin our discussion of unsupervised techniques for dimensionality re\\xad\\nduction by restricting our attention to linear transformations. Our goal is to \\nmap vectors xn in a d-dimensional space (a:i,... ,Xd) onto vectors zn in an M-\\ndimensional space (z\\\\,..., ZM), where M < d. We first note that the vector x \\ncan be represented, without loss of generality, as a linear combination of a set of \\nd orthonormal vectors u, \\nd \\nx^J^znu (8.12) 8.6: Principal component analysis 311 \\nwhere the vectors u< satisfy the orthonormality relation \\nujuj = 6ij (8.13) \\nin which 5y is the Kronecker delta symbol defined on page xiii. Explicit expres\\xad\\nsions for the coefficients z, in (8.12) can be found by using (8.13) to give \\nZi = uTx (8.14) \\nwhich can be regarded as a simple rotation of the coordinate system from the \\noriginal I'S to a new set of coordinates given by the z's (Appendix A). Now\", 'suppose that we retain only a subset M < d of the basis vectors ujt so that \\nwe use only M coefficients z,. The remaining coefficients will be replaced by \\nconstants b, so that each vector x is approximated by an expression of the form \\nM d \\nx = Y^ZiUi+ Yl biUi. (8.15) \\nt=l i=M+l \\nThis represents a form of dimensionality reduction since the original vector x \\nwhich contained d degrees of freedom must now be approximated by a new \\nvector z which has M < d degrees of freedom. Now consider a whole data set of \\nN vectors xn where n = 1,..., N. We wish to choose the basis vectors Uj and \\nthe coefficients bj such that the approximation given by (8.15), with the values \\nof Zi determined by (8.14), gives the best approximation to the original vector x \\non average for the whole data set. The error in the vector xn introduced by the \\ndimensionality reduction is given by \\nd \\nxn-x\" = Y, (*?-fcK (816) \\nt=M+l \\nWe can then define the best approximation to be that which minimizes the sum', 'of the squares of the errors over the whole data set. Thus, we minimize \\nn=l n=K=M+l \\nwhere we have used the orthonormality relation (8.13). If we set the derivative \\nof EM with respect to bi to zero we find \\nbi = jjY, *<=*?* (8-18) 71— 1 312 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nwhere we have denned the mean vector x to be \\nx = lf>\". (8.19) \\nUsing (8.14) and (8.18) we can write the sum-of-squares error (8.17) as \\nE«=\\\\ E i>7(*\"-x)}2 \\n«=Af+ln=l \\n= i J2 u?Su» (8-2°) i=M+l \\nwhere £ is the covariance matrix of the set of vectors {xn} and is given by \\n£ = ^(xn - x)(x\" - x)T. (8.21) \\nn \\nThere now remains the task of minimizing EM with respect to the choice of basis \\nvectors Uj. It is shown in Appendix E that the minimum occurs when the basis \\nvectors satisfy \\n£u* = AjUi (8.22) \\nso that they are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Note that, since the \\ncovariance matrix is real and symmetric, its eigenvectors can indeed be chosen', 'to be orthonormal as assumed. Substituting (8.22) into (8.20), and making use \\nof the orthonormality relation (8.13), we obtain the value of the error criterion \\nat the minimum in the form \\n1 d \\ni=M+l \\nThus, the minimum error is obtained by choosing the d—M smallest eigenvalues, \\nand their corresponding eigenvectors, as the ones to discard. \\nThe linear dimensionality reduction procedure derived above is called the \\nKarhunen-Loeve transformation or principal component analysis and is discussed \\nat length in Jollife (1986). Each of the eigenvectors Uj is called a principal com\\xad\\nponent. The technique is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.9 for the case of \\ndata points in two dimensions. \\nIn practice, the algorithm proceeds by first computing the mean of the vectors \\nx\" and then subtracting off this mean. Then the covariance matrix is calculated 8.6: Principal component analysis \\nU, \\nFigure 8.9. Schematic illustration of principal component analysis applied to', 'data in two dimensions. In a linear projection down to one dimension, the \\noptimum choice of projection, in the sense of minimizing the sum-of-squares \\nerror, is obtained by first subtracting off the mean x of the data set, and then \\nprojecting onto the first eigenvector m of the covariance matrix. \\nand its eigenvectors and eigenvalues are found. The eigenvectors corresponding \\nto the M largest eigenvalues are retained and the input vectors xn are projected \\nonto the eigenvectors to give the components of the transformed vectors z\" in \\nthe M-dimensional space. Thus, in Figure 8.9, each two-dimensional data point \\nis transformed to a single variable Z\\\\ representing the projection of the data \\npoint onto the eigenvector ui. \\nThe error introduced by a dimensionality reduction using principal compo\\xad\\nnent analysis can be evaluated using (8.23). In some applications the original data \\nhas a very high dimensionality and we wish only to retain the first few principal', \"components. In such cases use can be made of efficient algorithms which allow \\nonly the required eigenvectors, corresponding to the largest few eigenvalues, to \\nbe evaluated (Press et al., 1992). \\nWe have considered linear dimensionality reduction based on the sum-of-\\nsquares error criterion. It is possible to consider other criteria including data \\ncovariance measures and population entropy. These give rise to the same re\\xad\\nsult for the optimal dimensionality reduction in terms of projections onto the \\neigenvectors of S corresponding to the largest eigenvalues (Pukunaga, 1990). \\n8.6.1 Intrinsic dimensionality \\nSuppose we are given a set of data vectors in a d-dimensional space, and we \\napply principal component analysis and discover that the first d' eigenvalues have \\nsignificantly larger values than the remaining d—d! eigenvalues. This tells us that \\nthe data can be represented to a relatively high accuracy by projection onto the\", 'first dl eigenvectors. We therefore discover that the effective dimensionality of \\nthe data is less than the apparent dimensionality d, as a result of correlations \\nwithin the data. However, principal component analysis is limited by virtue of \\nbeing a linear technique. It may therefore be unable to capture more complex \\nnon-linear correlations, and may therefore overestimate the true dimensionality 314 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nFigure 8.10. Example of a data set in two dimensions which has an intrinsic \\ndimensionality d! = 1. The data can be specified not only in terms of the two \\nvariables xi wad xi, but also in terms of the single parameter n. However, a lin\\xad\\near dimensionality reduction technique, such as principal component analysis, \\nis unable to detect the lower dimensionality. \\nof the data. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.10, for data points which \\nlie around the perimeter of a circle. Principal component analysis would give two', \"eigenvectors with equal eigenvalues (as a result of the symmetry of the data). In \\nfact, however, the data could be described equally well by a single parameter 7] \\nas shown. More generally, a data set in d dimensions is said to have an intrinsic \\ndimensionality equal to d' if the data lies entirely within a rf'-dimensional sub-\\nspace (Pukunaga, 1982). \\nNote that if the data is slightly noisy, then the intrinsic dimensionality may \\nbe increased. Figure 8.11 shows some data in two dimensions which is corrupted \\nby a small level of noise. Strictly the data now lives in a two-dimensional space, \\nbut can nevertheless by represented to high accuracy by a single parameter. \\n8.6.2 Neural networks for dimensionality reduction \\nMulti-layer neural networks can themselves be used to perform non-linear dimen\\xad\\nsionality reduction, thereby overcoming some of the limitations of linear principal \\ncomponent analysis. Consider first a multi-layer perceptron of the form shown\", 'in Figure 8.12, having d inputs, d output units and M hidden units, with M < d \\n(Rumelhart et al, 1986). The targets used to train the network are simply the \\ninput vectors themselves, so that the network is attempting to map each input \\nvector onto itself. Due to the reduced number of units in the first layer, a perfect \\nreconstruction of all input vectors is not in general possible. The network can be \\ntrained by minimizing a sum-of-squares error of the form \\n£ = 5E2>*(xn)-^}2 (8.24) \\nn=lfc=l 8.6: Principal component analysis 315 \\nFigure 8.11. Addition of a small level of noise to data in two dimensions having \\nan intrinsic dimensionality of 1 can increase its intrinsic dimensionality to 2. \\nNevertheless, the data can be represented to a good approximation by a single \\nvariable r\\\\ and for practical purposes can be regarded as having an intrinsic \\ndimensionality of 1. \\noutputs \\ninputs \\nFigure 8.12.

Even with non-linear units in the hid\\xad\\nden layer, such a network is equivalent to linear principal component analysis. \\nBiases have been omitted for clarity. 316 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nnon-linear \\nnon-linear \\nFigure 8.13. Addition of extra hidden layers of non-linear units to the network \\nof Figure 8.12 gives an auto-associative network which can perform a general \\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction. Biases have been omitted for clarity. \\nSuch a network is said to form an auto-associative mapping. Error minimization \\nin this case represents a form of unsupervised training, since no independent \\ntarget data is provided. If the hidden units have linear activations functions, \\nthen it can be shown that the error function has a unique global minimum, and \\nthat at this minimum the network performs a projection onto the M-dimensional', 'sub-space which is spanned by the first M principal components of the data \\n(Bourlard and Kamp, 1988; Baldi and Hornik, 1989). Thus, the vectors of weights \\nwhich lead into the hidden units in Figure 8.12 form a basis set which spans the \\nprincipal sub-space. (Note, however, that these vectors need not be orthogonal \\nor normalized.) This result is not surprising, since both principal component \\nanalysis and the neural network are using linear dimensionality reduction and \\nare minimizing the same sum-of-squares error function. \\nIt might be thought that the limitations of a linear dimensionality reduction \\ncould be overcome by using non-linear (sigmoidal) activation functions for the \\nhidden units in the network in Figure 8.12. However, it was shown by Bourlard \\nand Kamp (1988) that such non-linearities make no difference, and that the mini\\xad\\nmum error solution is again given by the projection onto the principal component', 'sub-space. There is therefore no advantage in using two-layer neural networks to \\nperform dimensionality reduction. Standard techniques for principal component \\nanalysis (based on singular value decomposition) are guaranteed to give the cor\\xad\\nrect solution in finite time, and also generate an ordered set of eigenvalues with \\ncorresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. \\nThe situation is different, however, if additional hidden layers are permit\\xad\\nted in the network. Consider the four-layer auto-associative network shown in \\nFigure 8.13. Again the output units are linear, and the M units in the second \\nhidden layer can also be linear. However, the first and third hidden layers have \\nsigmoidal non-linear activation functions. The network is again trained by min- 8.6: Principal component analysis 317 \\nS(¥2) \\nFigure 8.14. Geometrical interpretation of the mappings performed by the \\nnetwork in Figure 8.13. \\nimization of the error in (8.24). We can view this network as two successive', 'functional mappings Fi and F2. The first mapping Fj projects the original d-\\ndimensional data onto an M-dimensional sub-space S defined by the activations \\nof the units in the second hidden layer. Because of the presence of the first hidden \\nlayer of non-linear units, this mapping is essentially arbitrary, and in particular \\nis not restricted to being linear. Similarly the second half of the network defines \\nan arbitrary functional mapping from the M-dimensional space back into the \\noriginal c/-dimensional space. This has a simple geometrical interpretation, as \\nindicated for the case d = 3 and M = 2 in Figure 8.14. The function F2 maps \\nfrom an M-dimensional space S into a d-dimensional space and therefore defines \\nthe way in which the space S is embedded within the original x-space. Since the \\nmapping F2 can be non-linear, the sub-space S can be non-planar, as indicated \\nin the figure. The mapping Fx then defines a projection of points in the original', 'd-dimensional space into the M-dimensional sub-space <S. \\nSuch a network effectively performs a non-linear principal component analy\\xad\\nsis. It has the advantage of not being limited to linear transformations, although \\nit contains standard principal component analysis as a special case. However, \\nthe minimization of the error function is now a non-linear optimization problem, \\nsince the error function in (8.24) is no longer a quadratic function of the network \\nparameters. Computationally intensive non-linear optimization techniques must \\nbe used (Chapter 7), and there is the risk of finding a sub-optimal local minimum \\nof the error function. Also, the dimensionality of the sub-space must be specified \\nin advance of training the network, so that in practice it may be necessary to \\ntrain and compare several networks having different values of M. An example of \\nthe application of this approach is given in Kramer (1991). 318 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction', 'Figure 8.15. An example of a simple classification problem for which princi\\xad\\npal component analysis would discard the discriminatory information. Two-\\ndimensional data is taken from two Gaussian classes C\\\\ and Ci depicted by the \\ntwo ellipses. Dimensionality reduction to one dimension using principal com\\xad\\nponent analysis would give a projection of the data onto the vector ui which \\nwould remove all ability to discriminate the two classes. The full discrimina\\xad\\ntory capability can be preserved if instead the data is projected onto the vector \\nU2, which is the direction which would be obtained from linear discriminant \\nanalysis. \\n8.6.3 Limitations of unsupervised techniques \\nWe have described both linear and non-linear unsupervised techniques for di\\xad\\nmensionality reduction. These can lead to significant improvements in the per\\xad\\nformance of subsequent regression or classification systems. It should be empha\\xad\\nsized, however, that methods based on unsupervised techniques take no account', 'of the target data, and can therefore give results which are substantially less \\nthan optimal. A reduction in dimensionality generally involves the loss of some \\ninformation, and it may happen that this information is very important for the \\nsubsequent regression or classification phase, even though it is of relatively little \\nimportance for representation of the input data itself. \\nAs a simple example, consider a classification problem involving input data \\nin two dimensions taken from two Gaussian-distributed classes as shown in Fig\\xad\\nure 8.15. Principal component analysis applied to this data would give the eigen\\xad\\nvectors ui and U2 as shown. If the dimensionality of the data were to be reduced \\nto one dimension using principal component analysis, then the data would be \\nprojected onto the vector Uj since this has the larger eigenvalue. However, this \\nwould lead to a complete loss of all discriminatory information, and the classes', \"would have identical distributions in the one-dimensional space. By contrast, a \\nprojection onto the vector 112 would give optimal class separation with no loss of \\ndiscriminatory information. Clearly this is an extreme example, and in practice \\ndimensionality reduction by unsupervised techniques can prove useful in many 8.7: Invariances and prior knowledge 319 \\napplications. \\nNote that in the example of Figure 8.15, a reduction of dimensionality us\\xad\\ning Fisher's linear discriminant (Section 3.6) would yield the optimal projection \\nvector U2. This is a consequence of the fact that it takes account of the class \\ninformation in selecting the projection vector. However, as we saw in Section 3.6, \\nfor a problem with c classes, Fisher's linear technique can only find c — 1 inde\\xad\\npendent directions. For problems with few classes and high input dimensionality \\nthis may result in too drastic a reduction of dimensionality. Techniques such\", 'as principal component analysis do not suffer from this limitation and are able \\nto extract any number of orthogonal directions up to the dimensionality of the \\noriginal space. \\nIt is worth noting that there is an additional link between principal com\\xad\\nponent analysis and a class of linear neural network models which make use of \\nmodifications of the Hebb learning rule (Hebb, 1949). This form of learning in\\xad\\nvolves making changes to the value of a weight parameter in proportion to the \\nactivation values of the two units which are linked by that weight. Such net\\xad\\nworks can be made to perform principal component analysis of the data (Oja, \\n1982, 1989; Linsker, 1988; Sanger, 1989), and furthermore it can be arranged \\nthat the weights converge to orthonormal vectors along the principal component \\ndirections. For practical applications, however, there would appear to be little \\nadvantage in using such approaches compared with standard numerical analysis', \"techniques such as those described earlier. \\n8.7 Invariances and prior knowledge \\nThroughout this book we are considering the problem of setting up a multivariate \\nmapping (for regression or classification) on the basis of a set of training data. \\nIn many practical situations we have, in addition to the data itself, some general \\ninformation about the form which the mapping should take or some constraints \\nwhich it should satisfy. This is referred to as prior knowledge, and its inclusion \\nin the network design process can often lead to substantial improvements in \\nperformance. \\nWe have already encountered one form of prior knowledge expressed as prior \\nprobabilities of class membership in a classification problem (Section 1.8). These \\ncan be taken into account in an optimal way by direct use of Bayes' theorem, or by \\nintroducing weighting factors in a sum-of-squares error function (Section 6.6.2). \\nHere we concentrate on forms of prior knowledge concerned with various kinds of\", 'invariance. As we shall see, the required invariance properties can be built into \\nthe pre-processing stage, or they can be included in the network structure itself. \\nWhile the latter option does not strictly constitute part of the pre-processing, it \\nis discussed in this chapter for convenience. \\n8.7.1 Invariances \\nIn many practical applications it is known that the outputs in a classification or \\nregression problem should be unchanged, or invariant, when the input is subject \\nto various transformations. An important example is the classification of objects 320 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nin two-dimensional images. A particular object should be assigned the same \\nclassification even if it is rotated or translated within the image or if it is linearly \\nscaled (corresponding to the object moving towards or away from the camera). \\nSuch transformations produce significant changes in the raw data (expressed in', 'terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image) and yet should give \\nrise to the same output from the classification system. We shall use this object \\nrecognition example to illustrate the use of invariances in neural networks. It \\nshould be borne in mind, however, that the same general principles apply to any \\nproblem for which it is desired to incorporate invariance with respect to a set of \\ntransformations. \\nBroadly we can identify three basic approaches to the construction of invari\\xad\\nant classification (or regression) systems based on neural networks (Barnard and \\nCasasent, 1991): \\n1. The first approach is to train a network by example. This involves includ\\xad\\ning within the training set a sufficiently large number of examples of the \\neffects of the various transformations. Thus, for translation invariance, the \\ntraining set should include examples of objects at many different positions. \\nIf suitable training data is not readily available then it can be generated by', 'applying the transformations to the existing data, for example by translat\\xad\\ning a single image to generate several images of the same object at different \\nlocations. \\n2. The second approach involves making a choice of pre-processing which in\\xad\\ncorporates the required invariance properties. If features are extracted from \\nthe raw data which are themselves invariant, then any subsequent regres\\xad\\nsion or classification system will necessarily also respect these invariances. \\n3. The final option is to build the invariance properties into the network struc\\xad\\nture itself. One way to achieve this is through the use of shared weights, \\nand we shall consider two specific examples involving local receptive fields \\nand higher-order networks. \\nWhile approach 1 is relatively straightforward, it suffers from the disadvantage \\nof being inefficient in requiring a substantially expanded data set. It will also \\nresult in a network which only approximately respects the invariance. Further\\xad', 'more, the network will be unable to deal with new inputs in which the range of \\nthe transformation exceeds that encountered during training, as this represents \\nan extrapolation of the network inputs. Methods 2 and 3 achieve the required \\ninvariance properties without needing unnecessarily large data sets. In the con\\xad\\ntext of translation invariance, for instance, a network which has been trained \\nto recognize an object correctly at one position within an image can recognize \\nthe same object correctly at any position. In contrast to a network trained by \\nmethod 1, such a network is able to extrapolate to new inputs if they differ from \\nthe training data primarily by virtue of one of the transformations. \\nAn alternative approach which also involves incorporating invariances through \\ntraining, but which does not require artificial expansion of the data set, is the \\ntechnique of tangent prop (Simard et al., 1992). Consider the effect of a trans- 8.7: Invariances and prior knowledge 321', 'a M \\nFigure 8.16.

Provided the transformation \\nis continuous (such as translation or rotation, but not mirror reflection for in\\xad\\nstance) then the transformed pattern will sweep out a manifold M within the \\nd-dimensional input space.

A related technique, called tangent distance, can be \\nused to build invariance properties into distance-based methods such as nearest-\\nneighbour classifiers (Simard et al, 1993). \\n8.7.2 Invariance through pre-processing \\nThe second approach which we shall consider for incorporating invariance prop\\xad\\nerties into neural network mappings is by a suitable choice of pre-processing. \\nOne such technique involves the extraction of features from the original input', \"data which are invariant under the required transformations. Such features are \\noften based on moments of the original data. For inputs which consist of a two-\\ndimensional image, the moments are defined by \\nx{u, v)K{u, v) du dv (8.29) \\n// 8.7: Invariances and prior knowledge 323 \\nwhere (u,v) are Cartesian coordinates describing locations within the image, \\nx(u,v) represents the intensity of the image at location (u,v), and K(u,v) is \\ncalled a kernel and is a fixed function whose form determines the particular \\nmoments under consideration. In practice, an image is specified in terms of a \\nfinite array of pixels, and so the integrals in (8.29) are replaced by discrete sums \\n^^xiuuvrfKiuijV^AuiAvj. (8.30) \\nWhen the kernel function takes the form of simple powers we have regular mo\\xad\\nments which, in continuous notation, can be written \\nMlm = [J x{u, v)u'vm du dv (8.31) \\nwhere I and m are non-negative integers. We can define a corresponding set of\", 'translation-invariant features, called central moments, by first subtracting off the \\nmeans of u and v \\nMlm = / / x{u, v)(u - u)l(v - v)m dudv (8.32) \\nwhere u = Mio/Moo and v = MQI/MQQ. Under a translation of the image \\nx(u,v) —> x(u + Au,v + Aw), and it is easy to verify that the moments de\\xad\\nfined in (8.32) are invariant. Note that this neglects edge effects and assumes \\nthat the integrals in (8.32) run over (—00,00). In practice, the use of moments \\nin the discrete form (8.30) will give only approximate invariance under such \\ntransformations. \\nSimilarly, under a change of scale we have x(u, v) —> x(au, av). We can make \\nthe central moments invariant to scale by normalizing them to give \\nW™ = oi+(i+m)/a (8-3^ \\niWoo \\nand again it is easy to verify that the normalized moments in (8.33) are simulta\\xad\\nneously invariant to translations and scaling. Similarly, we can use the moments \\nin (8.33) in turn to construct moments which are simultaneously invariant to', 'translation, scale and rotation (Exercise 8.7). For instance, the quantity \\n/*20 + M02 (8-34) \\nhas this property (Schalkoff, 1989). Other forms of moments can also be consid\\xad\\nered which are based on different forms for the kernel function K(u,v) (Khotan-\\nzad and Hong, 1990). \\nS. 324 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nFigure 8.17. Illustration of a three-dimensional input space showing trajecto\\xad\\nries, such as M, which patterns sweep out under the action of transformations \\nto which the network outputs should be invariant. A suitably chosen set of \\nconstraints will define a sub-space T which intersects each trajectory precisely \\nonce. If new inputs are mapped onto this surface using the transformations \\nthen invariance is guaranteed. \\nOne problem with the use of moments as input features is that considerable \\ncomputational effort may be required for their evaluation, and this computation \\nmust be repeated for each new input image. A second problem is that a lot', 'of information is discarded in evaluating any particular moment, and so many \\nmoments may be required in order to give good discrimination. \\nAn alternative, related approach to invariant pre-processing is to transform \\nany new inputs so as to satisfy some appropriately chosen set of constraints \\n(Barnard and Casasent, 1991). This is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.17 \\nfor a set of one-parameter transformations. Under the action of the transforma\\xad\\ntions, each input vector sweeps out a trajectory M as discussed earlier. Those \\npatterns which satisfy the constraints live on a sub-space T which intersects the \\ntrajectories. Note that the constraints must be chosen so that each trajectory \\nintersects the constraint surface at precisely one point. Any new input vector \\nis first transformed (thus moving it along its trajectory) until it reaches the \\nconstraint surface. This transformed vector is then used as the input to the net\\xad', 'work. As an example, suppose we wish to impose invariance to translations and \\nchanges of scale. The constraints might then take the form that the zeroth and \\nfirst moments Moo, Afio and Moi, given by (8.31), should have specified values. \\nEvery image (for the training set or test set) is first transformed by translation \\nand scaling until the constraints are satisfied. \\n8.7.3 Shared weights \\nThe third approach to dealing with invariances, discussed above, involves struc\\xad\\nturing the network itself in such a way that the network mapping respects the Figure 8.18. Schematic architecture of a network for translation-invariant ob\\xad\\nject recognition in two-dimensional images. In a practical system there may \\nbe more than two layers between the input image and the outputs. \\ninvariances. While, strictly, this is not a form of pre-processing, it is treated here \\nfor convenience. Again, we introduce this concept in the context of networks', 'designed for object recognition in two-dimensional images. \\nConsider the network structure shown in Figure 8.18. The inputs to the net\\xad\\nwork are given by the intensities at each of the pixels in a two-dimensional array. \\nUnits in the first and second layers are similarly arranged in two-dimensional \\nsheets to reflect the geometrical structure of the problem. Instead of having full \\ninterconnections between adjacent layers, each hidden unit receives inputs only \\nfrom units in a small region in the previous layer, known as a receptive field. \\nThis reflects the results of experiments in conventional image processing which \\nhave demonstrated the advantage of extracting local features from an image and \\nthen combining them together to form higher-order features. Note that it also \\nimitates some aspects of the mammalian visual processing system. The network \\narchitecture is typically chosen so that there is some overlap between adjacent \\nreceptive fields.', 'The technique of shared weights can then be used to build in some degree \\nof translation invariance into the response of the network (Rumelhart et al, \\n1986; Le Cun et al, 1989; Lang et al., 1990). In the simplest case this involves \\nconstraining the weights from each receptive field to be equal to the correspond\\xad\\ning weights from all of the receptive fields of the other units in the same layer. \\nConsider an object which falls within receptive field shown at A in Figure 8.18, \\ncorresponding to a unit in hidden layer 1, and which produces some activation \\nlevel in that unit. If the same object falls at the corresponding position in re\\xad\\nceptive field B, then, as a consequence of the shared weights, the corresponding 326 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nunit in hidden layer 1 will have the same activation level. The units in the second \\ni layer have fixed weights chosen so that each unit computes a simple average of', '; the activations of the units that fall within its receptive field. This allows units \\nin the second layer to be relatively insensitive to moderate translations within \\nthe input image. However, it does preserve some positional information thereby \\nallowing units in higher layers to detect more complex composite features. Typi\\xad\\ncally each successive layer has fewer units than previous layers, as information on \\nthe spatial location of objects is gradually eliminated. This corresponds to the \\nuse of a relatively high resolution to detect the presence of a feature in an earlier \\nlayer, while using a lower resolution to represent the location of that feature in \\na subsequent layer. \\nIn a practical network there may be several pairs of layers, with alternate \\nlayers having fixed and adaptive weights. These gradually build up increasing \\ntolerance to shifts in the input image, so that the final output layer has a response', \"which is almost entirely independent of the position of an object in the input \\nfield. \\nAs described so far, this network architecture has only one kind of receptive \\nfield in each layer. In order to be able to extract several different kinds of feature \\nis necessary to provide several 'planes' of units in each hidden layer, with all \\nunits in a given plane sharing the same weights. Weight sharing can be enforced \\nduring learning by initializing corresponding weights to the same (random) values \\nand then averaging the weight changes for all of the weights in one group and \\nupdating all of the corresponding weights by the same amount using the averaged \\nweight change. \\nNetwork architectures of this form have been used in the zip code recogni\\xad\\ntion system of Le Cun et al. (1989), and in the neocognitron of Fukushima et al. \\n(1983) and Fukushima (1988), for translation-invariant recognition of handwrit\\xad\\nten digits.\", \"i The use of receptive fields can dramatically reduce the number of weights \\npresent in the network compared with a fully connected architecture. This makes \\n) it practical to treat pixel values in an image directly as inputs to a network. \\nI In addition, the use of shared weights means that the number of independent \\nj parameters in the network is much less than the number of weights, which allows \\n' much smaller data sets to be used than would otherwise be necessary. \\n8.7.4 Higher-order networks for encoding invariances \\nIn Section 4.5 we introduced the concept of a higher-order network based on \\nunits whose outputs are given by \\n(d d d \\\\ \\nwi + Yl wHiXii + YU2 wJUi2xhxh + •••) (8-35) tl = l j1=lt2 = l / \\nwhere xt is an input, g(-) is a non-linear activation function and the w's rep\\xad\\nresent the weights. We have already remarked that such networks can have a 8.7: Invariances and prior knowledge 327 \\nFigure 8.19.

(The number of independent parameters per unit is the same as for the \\ncorresponding multivariate polynomial, and is discussed in Exercises 1.6-1.8.) \\nHowever, we can exploit the structure of a higher-order network to impose in\\xad\\nvariances, and at the same time reduce significantly the number of independent \\nweights in the network, by using a form of weight sharing (Giles and Maxwell, \\n1987; Perantonis and Lisboa, 1992). Consider the problem of incorporating trans\\xad\\nlation invariance into a higher-order network. This can be achieved by using a \\nsecond-order network of the form \\nzi = 9 [YlYiwihi2XiiXi2 I • (8-36) \\n\\\\ h «2 /\", \"Under a translation, the value of the intensity in pixel i\\\\ will go from its original \\nvalue XJI to a new value x'it given by x'tl = x^ where the translation can \\nbe described by a vector from pixel i\\\\ to pixel i\\\\. Thus the argument of the \\nactivation function g(-) in (8.36) will be invariant if, for each unit j in the first \\nhidden layer, we have \\nwjhi2 = Wj^. (8.37) \\nThis has a simple geometrical interpretation as indicated in Figure 8.19. Each \\nunit in the first hidden layer takes inputs from two pixels in the image, such \\nas those labelled i\\\\ and i2 in the figure. The constraint in (8.37) requires that, \\nfor each unit in the first hidden layer, and for each possible pair of points in the \\nimage, the weights from any other pair of points, such as those at i'x and i'2 which \\ncan be obtained from i\\\\ and i2 by translation, must be equal. Note that such 328 8: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction \\nan approach would not work with a first-order network, since the constraint on\", \"the weights would force all weights into any given unit to be equal. Each unit \\nwould therefore take as input something proportional to the average of all of the \\ninput pixel values and, while this would be translation invariant, there would be \\nno freedom left for the units to detect any structure in the image. Edge effects, \\nas well as the discrete nature of the pixels, have been neglected here, and in \\npractice the invariance properties will be only approximately realized. \\nHigher-order networks can be made invariant to more complex transforma\\xad\\ntions.

This selects all pairs of points such \\nthat the line i'\\\\-i'i is parallel to the line i\\\\-i2- There is a slight complication in \\nthe case of scaling arising from the fact that the input image consists of discrete \\npixels. If a given geometrical object is scaled by a factor A then the number of \\npixels which it occupies is scaled by a factor A2. If the image consists of black\", 'pixels (value +1) on a white background (value 0) for instance, then the number \\nof active pixels will be scaled by A2, which would spoil the scale invariance. The \\nproblem can be avoided by normalizing the image, e.g. to a vector of unit length. \\nNote that this then gives fractional values for the inputs. \\nIf we consider simultaneous translation, rotation and scale invariance, we see \\nthat any pair of points can be mapped to any other pair by a combination of such \\ntransformations. Thus a second-order network would be constrained to have all \\nweights to any hidden unit equal, which would again cause the activation of each \\nunit to be simply proportional to the average of the input values. We therefore \\nneed to go to a third-order network. In this case, each unit takes inputs from \\nthree pixels in the image, and the weights must satisfy the constraint that, for \\nevery triplet of pixels, and for every hidden unit, the weights must equal those Exercises 329', 'Figure 8.20. Simultaneous translation, rotation and scale invariance can be \\nbuilt into a third-order network provided weights from triplets of points which \\ncorrespond to similar triangles, such as those shown in (a) and (b), are con\\xad\\nstrained to be equal. \\nemanating from any other triplet which can be obtained by any combination of \\ntranslations, rotations and scalings (Reid et ah, 1989).

This is illustrated in Fig-\\nI ure 8.20. Although the incorporation of constraints greatly reduces the number \\nof free parameters in higher-order networks, the use of such networks is not \\nwidespread. \\nExercises \\n8.1 (*) Verify that the whitened input vector, given by (8.6), has zero mean and \\na covariance matrix given by the identity matrix.', '8.2 (*) Consider a radial basis function network with spherical Gaussian basis \\nfunctions in which the jth basis function is governed by a mean /x and a \\nvariance parameter a?

This is \\nimportant if the network is to exhibit good generalization, that is, to make good \\npredictions for new inputs. In Section 1.5, we introduced the simple analogy \\nof curve fitting using polynomials, and showed that a polynomial with too few \\ncoefficients gives poor predictions for new data, i.e. poor generalization, since \\nthe polynomial function has too little flexibility. Conversely, a polynomial with \\ntoo many coefficients also gives poor generalization since it fits too much of the \\nnoise on the training data. The number of coefficients in the polynomial controls \\nthe effective flexibility, or complexity, of the model. \\nThis highlights the need to optimize the complexity of the model in order to \\nachieve the best generalization. Considerable insight into this phenomenon can', 'be obtained by introducing the concept of the bias-variance trade-off, in which \\nthe generalization error is decomposed into the sum of the bias squared plus the \\nvariance. A model which is too simple, or too inflexible, will have a large bias, \\nwhile one which has too much flexibility in relation to the particular data set \\nwill have a large variance. Bias and variance are complementary quantities, and \\nthe best generalization is obtained when we have the best compromise between \\nthe conflicting requirements of small bias and small variance. \\nIn order to find the optimum balance between bias and variance we need \\nto have a way of controlling the effective complexity of the model. In the case \\nof neural networks, the complexity can be varied by changing the number of \\nadaptive parameters in the network. This is called structural stabilization. One \\nway to implement this in practice is to compare a range of models having different', 'different numbers of hidden units. Alternatively, we can start with a relatively \\nlarge network and prune out the least significant connections, either by removing \\nindividual weights or by removing complete units. Similarly, we can start with \\na small network, and add units during the learning process, with the goal of \\narriving at an optimal network structure. Yet another way to reduce variance is \\nto combine the outputs of several networks together to form a committee. \\nThe second principal approach to controlling the complexity of a model is \\nthrough the use of regularization which involves the addition of a penalty term \\nto the error function. We can control the degree of regularization, and hence \\nthe effective complexity of the model, by scaling the regularization term by an 9.1: Bias and variance 333 \\nadjustable multiplicative parameter. \\nIn a practical application, we have to optimize the model complexity for the', 'given training data set. One of the most important techniques for doing this is \\ncalled cross-validation. \\nIn Chapter 10 we discuss the Bayesian framework which provides a com\\xad\\nplimentary viewpoint to the one presented in this chapter. The bias-variance \\ntrade-off is then no longer relevant, and we can in principle consider networks of \\narbitrarily high complexity without encountering over-fitting. \\n9.1 Bias and variance \\nIn Section 1.5 we discussed the problem of curve fitting using polynomial func\\xad\\ntions, and we showed that there is an optimal number of coefficients for the \\npolynomial, for a given training set, in order to obtain the best representation \\nof the underlying systematic properties of the data, and hence to obtain the \\nbest generalization on new data. This represents a trade-off between achieving a \\ngood fit to the training data, and obtaining a reasonably smooth function which \\nis not over-fitted to the data. Similar considerations apply to the problem of', 'density estimation, discussed in Chapter 2, where various smoothing parameters \\narise which control the trade-off between smoothing the model density function \\nand fitting the data set. The same issues also arise in the supervised training of \\nneural networks. \\nA key insight into this trade-off comes from the decomposition of error into \\nbias and variance components (Geman et al, 1992). We begin with a mathemat\\xad\\nical treatment of the bias-variance decomposition, and then discuss its implica\\xad\\ntions. \\nIt is convenient to consider the particular case of a model trained using a sum-\\nof-squares error function, although our conclusions will be much more general. \\nAlso, for notational simplicity, we shall consider a network having a single output \\ny, although again this is not a significant limitation. We showed in Section 6.1.3 \\nthat the sum-of-squares error, in the limit of an infinite data set, can be written \\nin the form \\n£=^/Mx)-(t|x)}2p(x)dx \\n+ \\\\j{(t2\\\\x)-(t\\\\x)2}p(X)dx (9.1)', 'in which p(x) is the unconditional density of the input data, and (i|x) denotes \\nthe conditional average, or regression, of the target data given by \\n(t\\\\x) s / tp(t\\\\x) dt (9.2) 334 9: Learning and Generalization \\nwhere p(t\\\\x) is the conditional density of the target variable t conditioned on the \\ninput vector x. Similarly \\n(t2\\\\x) = f t2p(t\\\\x) dt. (9.3) \\nNote that the second term in (9.1) is independent, of the network function \\n?/(x) and hence is independent of the network weights. The optimal network \\nfunction y(x), in the sense of minimizing the sum-of-squares error, is the one \\nwhich makes the first term in (9.1) vanish, and is given by y(x) = (t\\\\x). The \\nsecond term represents the intrinsic noise in the data and sets a lower limit on \\nthe error which can be achieved. \\nIn a practical situation we must deal with the problems arising from a finite-\\nsize data set. Suppose we consider a training set D consisting of N patterns which', 'we use to determine our network model y(x). Now consider a whole ensemble of \\npossible data sets, each containing N patterns, and each taken from the same \\nfixed joint distribution p(x, t). We have already argued that the optimal network \\nmapping is given by the conditional average (t\\\\x). A measure of how close the \\nactual mapping function y(x) is to the desired one is given by the integrand of \\nthe first term in (9.1): \\n{y(x) - (*|x)}2. (9.4) \\nThe value of this quantity will depend on the particular data set D on which it \\nis trained. We can eliminate this dependence by considering an average over the \\ncomplete ensemble of data sets, which we write as \\n£D[{y(x) - (t\\\\x)f] (9.5) \\nwhere £js>\\\\-] denotes the expectation, or ensemble average, and we recall that the \\nfunction y(x) depends on the particular data set D which is used for training. \\nNote that this expression is itself a function of x. \\nIf the network function were always a perfect predictor of the regression func\\xad', 'tion (t\\\\x) then this error would be zero. As we shall see, a non-zero error can \\narise for essentially two distinct reasons. It may be that the network function \\nis on average different from the regression function. This is called bins. Alter\\xad\\nnatively, it may be that the network function is very sensitive to the particular \\ndata set D, so that, at a given x, it is larger than the required value for some \\ndata sets, and smaller for other data sets. This is called variance. We can make \\nthe decomposition into bias and variance explicit by writing (9.5) in somewhat \\ndifferent, but mathematically equivalent, form. First we expand the term in curly \\nbrackets in (9.5) to give \\n{y(x) - (t|x)}2 = {y(x) - £D\\\\y(x)} + £D[y(x)} - (t\\\\x)}2 9.1: Bias and variance 335 \\n= (i,(x) - £D[t/(x)]}2 + {£D[y(x)\\\\ - {t\\\\x)f \\n+2{y(x) - SD[y{x)]}{£D[y(x)) - (t|x». (9.6) \\nIn order to compute the expression in (9.5) we take the expectation of both sides', \"of (9.6) over the ensemble of data sets D. We see that the third term on the \\nright-hand side of (9.6) vanishes, and we are left with \\n£D[{y(x) - <t.|x»2j \\n= {£D[y(x)] - <<|x>}2 + £D[{y{x) - £D[y(x)}}2}. (9.7) v ' v v ' \\n(bias)2 variance \\nIt is worth studying the expressions in (9.7) closely. The bias measures the extent \\nto which the average (over all data sets) of the network function differs from the \\ndesired function (<|x). Conversely the variance measures the extent to which the \\nnetwork function y(x) is sensitive to the particular choice of data set. Note that \\nthe expressions for bias and variance are functions of the input vector x. We can \\nalso introduce corresponding average values for bias and variance by integrating \\nover all x. By referring back to (9.1) we see that the appropriate weighting for \\nthis integration is given by the unconditional density p(x), so that \\n(bias)2 = \\\\ j{£D\\\\y{x)\\\\ - (<|x»2p(x) rfx (9.8) \\nvariance = i f £D[{y{x) ~ £D[y{x)}}2}p{x) dx.

We shall suppose \\nthat the target data for network training is generated from a smooth function \\n/i(x) to which zero mean random noise e is added, so that \\ntn = h(x.n) + en. (9.10) \\nNote that the optimal mapping function in this case is given by (t|x) = h(x). One \\nchoice of model for y(x) would be some fixed function <?(x) which is completely \\nindependent of the data set D, as indicated in Figure 9.1. It is clear that the \\nvariance term in (9.7) will vanish, since £D[?/(X)] = p(x) = j/(x). However, the \\nbias term will typically be high since no attention at all was paid to the data, and \\nso unless we have some prior knowledge which helps us to choose the function \\ng(x) we are making a wild guess. 336 9: Learning and Generalization \\nFigure 9.1.

In this case \\nthe bias term vanishes at the data points themselves since \\n£D\\\\y(x)] = £D[h{x) + e} = ft(x) = (t\\\\x) (9.11) \\nand the bias will typically be small in the neighbourhood of the data points. The \\nvariance, however, will be significant since 9.1: Bias and variance 337 \\n£D[{VW - £D[2/(X)]}2] = £D[{y(x) - h(X)}2} = £r>[e2} (9.12)', 'which is just the variance of the noise on the data, which could be substantial. \\nWe see that there is a natural trade-off between bias and variance. A function \\nwhich is closely fitted to the data set will tend to have a large variance and \\nhence give a large expected error. We can decrease the variance by smoothing \\nthe function, but if this is taken too far then the bias becomes large and the \\nexpected error is again large. This trade-off between bias and variance plays a \\ncrucial role in the application of neural network techniques to practical problems. \\nWe shall give a simple example of the dependence of bias and variance on the \\neffective model complexity in Section 9.8.1. \\n9.1.1 Minimizing bias and variance \\nWe have seen that, for any given size of data set, there is some optimal balance \\nbetween bias and variance which gives the smallest average generalization error. \\nIn order to improve the performance of the network further we need to be able', 'to reduce the bias while at the same time also reducing the variance. One way \\nto achieve this is to use more data points. As we increase the number of data \\npoints we can afford to use more complex models, and therefore reduce bias, \\nwhile at the same time ensuring that each model is more heavily constrained \\nby the data, thereby also reducing variance. If we increase the number of data \\npoints sufficiently rapidly in relation to the model complexity we can find a \\nsequence of models such that both bias and variance decrease. Models such as \\nfeed-forward neural networks can in principle provide consistent estimators of \\nthe regression function, meaning that they can approximate the regression to \\narbitrary accuracy in the limit as the number of data points goes to infinity. \\nThis limit requires a subtle balance of network complexity against number of \\ndata points to ensure that at each step both bias and variance are decreased.', 'Consistency has been widely studied in the context of conventional techniques \\nfor statistical pattern recognition. For feed-forward networks, White (1990) has \\nshown how the complexity of a two-layer network must grow in relation to the \\nsize of the data set in order to be consistent. This does not, however, tell us the \\ncomplexity required for any given number of data points. It also requires that the \\nparameter optimization algorithms are capable of finding the global minimum of \\nthe error function. Note that, even if both bias and variance can be reduced to \\nzero, the error on new data will still be non-zero as a result of the intrinsic noise \\non the data given by the second term in (9.1). \\nIn practice we are often limited in the number of training patterns available, \\nand in many applications this may indeed be a severe limitation. An alternative \\napproach to reducing both bias and variance becomes possible if we have some', 'prior knowledge concerning the unknown function h(x). Such knowledge can be \\nused to constrain the model function y(x) in a way which is consistent with h(x) \\nand which therefore does not give rise to increased bias. Note that the bias-\\nvariance problem implies that, for example, a simple linear model (single-layer \\nnetwork) might, in some applications involving relatively small data sets; give 338 9: Learning and Generalization \\nsuperior performance to a more general non-linear model (such as a multi-layer \\nnetwork) even though the latter contains the linear model as a special case. \\n9.2 Regularization \\nIn Section 1.5 we saw that a polynomial with an excess of free coefficients tends \\nto generate mappings which have a lot of curvature and structure, as a result of \\nover-fitting to the noise on the training data. Similar behaviour also arises with \\nmore complex non-linear neural network models. The technique of regulariza\\xad', 'tion encourages smoother network mappings by adding a penalty Q. to the error \\nfunction to give \\nE = E + vQ. (9.13) \\nHere E is one of the standard error functions as discussed in Chapter 6, and \\nthe parameter v controls the extent to which the penalty term Q influences \\nthe form of the solution. Training is performed by minimizing the total error \\nfunction E, which requires that the derivatives of Q with respect to the network \\nweights can be computed efficiently. A function y(x) which provides a good fit \\nto the training data will give a small value for E, while one which is very smooth \\nwill give a small value for fi. The resulting network mapping is a compromise \\nbetween fitting the data and minimizing Q. Regularization is discussed in the \\ncontext of radial basis function networks in Section 5.4, and is given a Bayesian \\ninterpretation in Section 10.1. \\nIn this section we shall consider various forms for the regularization term il.', 'Regularization techniques have been extensively studied in the context of linear \\nmodels for y(x). For the case of one input variable x and one output variable y, \\nthe class of Tikhonov regularizes takes the form \\n^E/M*)(0)^ (9-14) \\nwhere hr > 0 for r = 0,... ,R - 1, and h,R > 0 (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977). \\nRegularization has also been widely studied in the context of vision systems \\n(Poggio et at, 1985). \\n9.2.1 Weight decay \\nOne of the simplest forms of regularizer is called weight decay and consists of the \\nsum of the squares of the adaptive parameters in the network \\nfi=±£>| (9.15) \\ni \\nwhere the sum runs over all weights and biases. In conventional curve fitting, \\nthe use of this form of regularizer is called ridge regression. It has been found 9.2: Regularization 339 \\nempirically that a regularizer of this form can lead to significant improvements \\nin network generalization (Hinton, 1987). Some heuristic justification for the', 'weight-decay regularizer can be given as follows. We know that to produce an \\nover-fitted mapping with regions of large curvature requires relatively large values \\nfor the weights. For small values of the weights the network mapping represented \\nby a multi-layer perceptron is approximately linear, since the central region of a \\nsigmoidal activation function can be approximated by a linear transformation. \\nBy using a regularizer of the form (9.15), the weights are encouraged to be small. \\nMany network training algorithms make use of the derivatives of the total \\nerror function with respect to the network weights, which from (9.13) and (9.15) \\nare given by \\nVE = VE + uw. (9.16) \\nSuppose that the data term E is absent and we consider training by simple gra\\xad\\ndient descent in the continuous-time limit. The weight vector W(T) then evolves \\nwith time r according to \\nrfw \\n— = -nV£ = -rjvvf (9.17) \\ndr \\nwhere 77 is the learning rate parameter. This equation has solution', \"w(r) = w(0) exp(-r?i/T) (9.18) \\nand so all of the weights decay exponentially to zero, which is the reason for the \\nuse of the term 'weight decay'. \\nWe can gain some further insight into the behaviour of the weight-decay \\nregularizer by considering the particular case of a quadratic error function. A \\ngeneral quadratic error can be written in the form \\n%) = £0 + bTw+-wTHw (9.19) \\nwhere the Hessian H and the vector b are constants. The minimum of this error \\nfunction occurs at the point w* which, by differentiating (9.19), satisfies \\nb + Hw* = 0. (9.20) \\nIn the presence of the regularization term, the minimum moves to a point w \\nwhich, from (9.13), satisfies \\nb + Hw + f/w = 0. (9.21) 340 9: Learning and Generalization \\nWe can better interpret the effect of the weight-decay term if we rotate the axes \\nin weight space so as to diagonalize the Hessian matrix H (Appendix A). This \\nis done by considering the eigenvector equation for the Hessian given by \\nHU^AJUJ. (9.22)\", 'We can now expand w* and w in terms of the eigenvectors to give \\nw* -^WjUj, w = ^«/,Uj. (9.23) \\nCombining (9.20), (9.21) and (9.23), and using the orthonormality of the {\\\\ij}, \\nwe obtain the following relation between the minima of the original and the \\nregularized error functions \\nWi = -r-^—u>!.

Along those directions for which the corresponding eigenvalues are rela\\xad\\ntively large, so that Xj S> u, (9.24) shows that uij c± wj, and so the minimum of \\nthe error function is shifted very little.

This effect is illustrated in Figure 9.3. \\n9.2.2 Consistency of weight decay \\nOne of the limitations of simple weight decay in the form (9.15) is that is incon\\xad', 'sistent with certain scaling properties of network mappings. To illustrate this, \\nconsider a multi-layer perceptron network having a single hidden layer and linear \\noutput units, which performs a mapping from a set of input variables Xj to a set \\nof output variables yk. The activation of a hidden unit in the first hidden layer \\nis given by \\nZj: = g I ]P WjiXi + WJO j (9.25) \\nwhile the activations of the output units are given by \\nVk = ^2 wkj ZJ + wk0.

Note that the axes in weight space have been rotated to be \\nparallel with the principal axes of the original error surface, determined by the', 'eigenvectors of the corresponding Hessian matrix.

(9.28) \\n(9.29) \\nSimilarly, a linear transformation of the output variables of the network of the \\nform \\n2/fc -• 2/k = cyk + d (9.30) \\ncan be achieved by making a transformation of the second-layer weights using \\nv>kj -* wki = cwkj (9.31) \\nWko —* yJko = cwko + d. (9.32) 342 9: Learning and Generalization \\nIf we train one network using the original data and one network using data for', 'which the input and/or target variables are transformed by one of the above lin\\xad\\near transformations, then consistency requires that we should obtain equivalent \\nnetworks which differ only by the linear transformation of the weights as given. \\nAny regularizer should be consistent with this property, otherwise it arbitrarily \\nfavours one solution over another, equivalent one. Clearly, simple weight decay \\n(9.15) which treats all weights and biases on an equal footing does not satisfy \\nthis property. \\nWe therefore look for a regularizer which is invariant under the linear trans\\xad\\nformations (9.28), (9.29), (9.31) and (9.32). In particular, the weights should \\nbe scale-invariant and the biases should be shift-invariant. Such a regularizer is \\ngiven by \\nu)6Wi ui€VV2 \\nwhere W\\\\ denotes the set of weights in the first layer, VV2 denotes the set of \\nweights in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations. Under', 'the linear transformations of the weights given by (9.28), (9.29), (9.31) and \\n(9.32), the regularizer will remain unchanged provided the parameters v\\\\ and v<i \\nare suitably rescaled. \\nIn Section 3.4.3 we showed that the role of the biases in the final layer of \\na network with linear outputs, trained by minimizing a sum-of-squares error \\nfunction, is to compensate for the difference between the mean (over the data \\nset) of the output vector from the network and the corresponding mean of the \\ntarget values. It is therefore reasonable to exclude the biases from the regularizer \\nas we do not wish systematically to distort the mean network output. The output \\nis then equal to the sample mean of the target data, and provides an unbiased \\nestimate of the true target mean. \\nWeight-decay regularizes can be motivated in the context of linear models by \\nconsidering the sensitivity of the model predictions to noise on the input vectors.', 'Minimization of this sensitivity leads naturally to a weight-decay regularizer, in \\nwhich the biases are excluded from the sum over weights (Exercise 9.2). The more \\ngeneral case of non-linear networks is covered in detail later, when we consider \\nthe training of networks with additive noise on the inputs. \\n9.2.3 A simple illustration of weight decay \\nAs an illustration of the use of weight decay, we return to the example used \\nin Section 5.1 of modelling a noisy sine function using a radial basis function \\nnetwork. In Figure 9.4 we show an example of a data set together with the \\nnetwork function obtained by minimizing a sum-of-squares error. Here data was \\ngenerated by sampling the function h(x) given by \\nh{x) = 0.5 + 0.4sin(27rx) (9.34) 9.S: Regularization 343 \\n1.0 \\ny \\n0.5 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 0.5 x 1.0 \\nFigure 9.4.

There is one Gaussian basis function for each of the 30 data points, and \\nthe result is a strongly over-fitted network mapping. (This figure is identical \\nto Figure 5.1, and is reproduced here for ease of comparison.) \\nand adding Gaussian distributed random noise with zero mean and standard \\ndeviation a — 0.05. There is one basis function centred on each data point, and \\nconsequently the network gives a strongly over-fitted solution. \\nWe now include a weight-decay regularizer of the form (9.15) with the bias \\nparameter excluded from the summation, for reasons discussed above. Figure 9.5 \\nshows the effect of using a regularization coefficient of v — 40. The network \\nmapping is now much smoother and gives a much closer representation of the \\nunderlying function from which the data was generated (shown by the dashed', 'curve). The degree of smoothing is controlled by the regularization coefficient t/, \\nand too large a value of v leads to over-smoothing, as illustrated for v = 1000 in \\nFigure 9.6. \\n9.2.4 Early stopping \\nAn alternative to regularization as a way of controlling the effective complexity of \\na network is the procedure of early stopping. The training of non-linear network \\nmodels corresponds to an iterative reduction of the error function defined with \\nrespect to a set of training data. During a typical training session, this error \\ngenerally decreases as a function of the number of iterations in the algorithm. \\nFor many of the algorithms described in Chapter 7 (such as conjugate gradients) \\nthe error is a monotonically decreasing function of the iteration index. However, \\nthe error measured with respect to independent data, generally called a validation \\nset, often shows a decrease at first, followed by an increase as the network starts 344 9: Learning and Generalization', \"Figure 9.5. As in Figure 9.4 but with a weight-decay regularizer and a reg-\\nularization coefficient u = 40, showing the much smoother network mapping \\nand the correspondingly closer agreement with the underlying generator of the \\ndata, shown by the dashed curve. \\nFigure 9.6. As in Figure 9.5 but with v = 1000, showing the effect of having \\ntoo large a value for the regularization coefficient. \\nto over-fit. Training can therefore be stopped at the point of smallest error with \\nrespect to new data, as indicated in Figure 9.7, since this gives a network which \\nis expected to have the best generalization performance. \\nThe behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualita\\xad\\ntively in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network. \\nThis number is suppose to start out small and then to grow during the train- 9.2: Regularization ;i'15 \\nE \\nX t \\nFigure 9.7.

The goal of achieving the best generalization performance suggests that \\ntraining should be stopped at the point T corresponding to the minimum of \\nthe validation set error. \\ning process, corresponding to a steady increase in the effective complexity of the \\nmodel. Halting training before a minimum of the training error has been reached \\nthen represents a way of limiting the effective network complexity. \\nIn the case of a quadratic error function, early stopping should give rise to \\nsimilar behaviour to regularization using a simple weight-decay term. This can \\nbe understood from Figure 9.8. The axes in weight space have been rotated to \\nbe parallel to the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. If, in the absence of weight \\ndecay, the weight vector starts at the origin and proceeds during training along \\na path which follows the local negative gradient vector, then the weight vector', 'will move initially parallel to the u>2 axis to a point corresponding roughly to \\nw and then move towards the minimum of the error function w*. This follows \\nfrom the shape of the error surface and the widely differing eigenvalues of the \\nHessian. Stopping at a point near w is therefore similar to weight decay. The \\nrelationship between early stopping and weight decay can be made quantitative, \\nas discussed in Exercise 9.1, thereby showing that the quantity rn (where T is \\nthe iteration index, and r) is the learning rate parameter) plays the role of the \\nreciprocal of the regularization parameter v. This exercise also shows that the \\neffective number of parameters in the network (i.e. the number of weights whose \\nvalues differ significantly from zero) grows during the course of training. \\n9.2.5 Curvature-driven smoothing \\nWe have seen that over-fitted solutions are generally characterized by mappings \\nwhich have a lot of structure and relatively high curvature. This provided some', 'indirect motivation for weight-decay regularizes as a way of reducing the curva\\xad\\nture of the network function. A more direct approach is to consider a regularizer \\nwhich penalizes curvature explicitly. Since the curvature is governed by the sec\\xad\\nond derivatives of the network function, we can consider a regularizer of the \\nform validation \\ntraining 346 9: Learning and Generalization \\nW, \\nFigure 9.8.

By stopping training early, a weight vector w is found which is \\nqualitatively similar to that obtained with a simple weight-decay regularizer', 'and training to the new minimum of the error, as can be seen by comparing \\nwith Figure 9.3.

A third approach is the technique of training with', \"noise, which involves the addition of noise to the input vectors during the train\\xad\\ning process. For sequential training algorithms, this can be done by adding a new \\nrandom vector to each input pattern before it is presented to the network, so \\nthat, if the patterns are being recycled, a different random vector is added each \\ntime. For batch methods, a similar effect can be achieved by replicating each \\ndata point a number of times and adding new random vectors onto each copy. 9.3: Training with noise 347 \\nHeuristically, we might expect that the noise will 'smear out' each data point \\nand make it difficult for the network to fit individual data points precisely, and \\nhence will reduce over-fitting. In practice, it has been demonstrated that training \\nwith noise can indeed lead to improvements in network generalization (Sietsma \\nand Dow, 1991). We now show that training with noise is closely related to the \\ntechnique of regularization (Bishop, 1995).\", 'Suppose we describe the noise on the inputs by the random vector £, governed \\nby some probability distribution p(£).

This result is analogous to the one obtained for the \\nouter product approximation for the Hessian matrix in Section 6.1.4, in which \\nwe showed that similar second-derivative terms also vanish.

This choice of regularizer leads to a computationally efficient algorithm \\nfor evaluating the gradients of the regularization function with respect to the \\nnetwork weights. The algorithm is equivalent to forward and backward propa\\xad\\ngation through an extended network architecture, and is termed double back-\\npropagation. \\n9.4 Soft weight sharing\", 'One way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number \\nof weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is \\nthe technique of weight sharing which was discussed in Section 8.7.3 as a way \\nof building translation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. \\nIt is only applicable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the \\nconstraints can be specified in advance. Here we consider a form of soft weight \\nsharing (Nowlan and Hinton, 1992) in which the hard constraint of equal weights \\nis replaced by a form of regularization in which groups of weights are encouraged \\nto have similar values. Furthermore, the division of weights into groups, the mean \\nweight value for each group, and the spread of values within the groups, are all \\ndetermined as part of the learning process. 350 9: Learning and Generalization \\nAs discussed at length in Chapter 6, an error function can be regarded as', 'the negative logarithm of a likelihood function. Thus, the simple weight-decay \\nregularizer (9.15) represents the negative logarithm of the likelihood of the given \\nset of weight values under a Gaussian distribution centred on the origin. To see \\nthis, consider a Gaussian of the form \\nP(W) = /o-M/2 eXP \\\\4\\\\ <^> <2T) \\nThen the likelihood of the set of weight values under this distribution is given \\nby \\nw 1 f l 1 \\nC = Y[P(Wi) = j—; exp j-- X>* j (9.47) \\nwhere W is the total number of weights. Taking the negative logarithm then \\ngives the weight-decay regularizer, up to an irrelevant additive constant. As we \\nhave seen, the weight-decay term has the effect of encouraging the weight values \\nto form a cluster with values close to zero. \\nWe can encourage the weight values to form several groups, rather than just \\none group, by considering a probability distribution which is a mixture of Gaus-\\nsians. An introduction to Gaussian mixture models and their basic properties is', 'given in Section 2.6. The centres and variances of the Gaussian components, as \\nwell as the mixing coefficients, will be considered as adjustable parameters to be \\ndetermined as part of the learning process. Thus, we have a probability density \\nof the form \\nM \\nP(w) = 5>^>) (9.48) \\nwhere aj are the mixing coefficients, and the component densities <f>j(w) are \\nGaussians of the form \\n^=(^expj-i^J. (^9) \\nForming the likelihood function in the usual way, and then taking the negative \\nlogarithm, leads to a regularizing function of the form \\nfi = -£ln|f>^.(Wi)J. (9.50) 9.4: Soft weight sharing 351 \\nThe total error function is then given by \\nE = E + u9, (9.51) \\nwhere v is the regularization coefficient. This error is minimized both with respect \\nto the weights W{ and with respect to the parameters a,-, fij and Oj of the \\nmixture model. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture \\nmodel could be determined by using the EM re-estimation procedure discussed', \"in Section 2.6.2. However, the distribution of weights is itself evolving during \\nthe learning process, and so to avoid numerical instability a joint optimization is \\nperformed simultaneously over the weights and the mixture model parameters. \\nThis can be done using one of the standard algorithms, such as the conjugate \\ngradient or quasi-Newton methods, described in Chapter 7. The parameter v, \\nhowever, cannot be optimized in this way, since this would give v -* 0 and an \\nover-fitted solution, but must be found using techniques such as cross-validation \\nto be discussed later. \\nIn order to minimize the total error function it is necessary to be able to \\nevaluate its derivatives with respect to the various adjustable parameters. To do \\nthis it is convenient to regard the ctj 's as prior probabilities, and to introduce \\nthe corresponding posterior probabilities given by Bayes' theorem in the form \\nThe derivatives of the total error function with respect to the weights are then \\ngiven by\", 'dE dE v-^ , Awi-fii) ,„„, \\n^r^+u^j{Wi)-^r- (953) 3 J \\nThe effect of the regularization term is thus to pull each weight towards the \\ncentre of the jth Gaussian, with a force proportional to the posterior probability \\nof that Gaussian for the given weight. This is precisely the kind of effect which \\nwe are seeking. \\nDerivatives of the error with respect to the centres of the Gaussians are also \\neasily computed to give \\ndE ^ (fii-Wj) , . \\ndfij j \\nwhich has a simple intuitive interpretation, since it drives /z,- towards an average \\nof the weight values, weighted by the posterior probabilities that the respective \\nweights were generated by component j.

Note that, in a practical implementation, new variables r\\\\j defined \\nby \\na? = exp(rjj) (9.56) \\nare introduced, and the minimization is performed with respect to the i)j. This \\nensures that the parameters cr, remain positive. It also has the effect of dis\\xad\\ncouraging pathological solutions in which one or more of the Oj goes to zero, \\ncorresponding to a Gaussian component collapsing onto one of the weight pa\\xad\\nrameter values. Such solutions are discussed in more detail in the context of \\nGaussian mixture models in Section 2.6. Prom a Bayesian perspective, the use \\nof a transformation of the form (9.56) can be motivated by a consideration of \\nnon-informative priors (Section 10.4 and Exercise 10.13). \\nFor the derivatives with respect to the mixing coefficients Qj, we need to take \\naccount of the constraints \\nJ2ctj = l, 0<cti<l (9.57)', \"which follow from the interpretation of the aj as prior probabilities. This can be \\ndone by expressing the mixing coefficients in terms of a set of auxiliary variables \\n{jj} using the softmax function given by \\n«*(7,)_ (958) \\n£fc=iexp(7fc) \\nWe can now minimize the error function with respect to the {7,-}. To find the \\nderivatives of E with respect to 7, we make use of \\n~ = 6jkaj - ajctk (9.59) \\nwhich follows from (9.58). Using the chain rule in the form 9.5: Growing and pruning algorithms 353 \\ndE _ ^ dE dak \\ndli ~ ^ dak dij \\ntogether with (9.50), (9.52) and (9.59), we then obtain the required derivatives \\nin the form \\n^E^-^'W) (9-61) \\nwhere we have made use of £V. <Xj = 1. We see that Qj is therefore driven towards \\nthe average posterior probability for component j. \\nIn practice it is necessary to take some care over the initialization of the \\nweights in order to ensure that good solutions are found. One approach is to\", 'choose the initial weights from a uniform distribution over a finite interval, and \\nthen initialize the components <j)j(w) to have means which are equally spaced over \\nthis interval, with equal priors, and variances equal to the spacing between the \\nadjacent means. This ensures that, for most of the weights, there is little initial \\ncontribution to the error gradient from the regularization term, and so the initial \\nevolution of the weights is primarily data-driven. Also, the posterior probabilities \\nhave roughly equal contributions over the complete set of weights, which helps \\nto avoid problems due to priors going to zero early in the optimization. Results \\non several test problems (Nowlan and Hinton, 1992) show that this method can \\nlead to significantly better generalization than simple weight decay. \\n9.5 Growing and pruning algorithms \\nThe architecture of a neural network (number of units and topology of connec\\xad', 'tions) can have a significant impact on its performance in any particular ap\\xad\\nplication. Various techniques have therefore been developed for optimizing the \\narchitecture, in some cases as part of the network training process itself. It is \\nimportant to distinguish between two distinct aspects of the architecture selec\\xad\\ntion problem. First, we need a systematic procedure for exploring some space of \\npossible architectures, and this forms the subject of this section. Second, we need \\nsome way of deciding which of the architectures considered should be selected. \\nThis is usually determined by the requirement of achieving the best possible \\ngeneralization, and is discussed at length in Section 9.8. \\nThe simplest approach to network structure optimization involves exhaustive \\nsearch through a restricted class of network architectures. We might for instance \\nconsider the class of multi-layer perceptrons having two layers of weights with', 'full connectivity between adjacent layers and no direct input-output connections. \\nThe only aspect of the architecture which remains to be specified is the number \\nM of hidden units, and so we train a set of networks having a range of values \\nof M, and select the one which gives the best value for our performance crite\\xad\\nrion. This approach can require significant computational effort and yet it only \\nsearches a very restricted class of network models. If we expand the range of 354 9: Learning and Generalization \\nmodels (by having multiple hidden layers and partial connectivity for example) \\nwe quickly reach the point of having insufficient computational resources for a \\ncomplete search. Note, however, that this is the approach which is most widely \\nadopted in practice. Some justification can be found in the fact that, for the two-\\nlayer architecture, we know that we can approximate any continuous functional', 'mapping to arbitrary accuracy (Section 4.3) provided M is sufficiently large. \\nAn obvious drawback of such an approach is that many different networks \\nhave to be trained. This can in principle be avoided by considering a network \\nwhich is initially relatively small and allowing new units and connections to be \\nadded during training. A simple example of this would be to consider the class of \\nnetworks having two layers of weights with full connections in each layer, and to \\nstart with a few hidden units and then add one unit at a time. Such an approach \\nwas considered by Bello (1992) who used the weights from one network as the \\ninitial guess for training the next network (with the extra weights initialized \\nrandomly). Techniques of this form are called growing algorithms and we shall \\nconsider some examples for networks of threshold units, and then discuss the \\ncascade correlation algorithm which uses sigmoidal units.', 'An alternative approach is to start with a relatively large network and grad\\xad\\nually remove either connections or complete units. These are known as pruning \\nalgorithms and we shall consider several specific examples. Note that, if weight \\nsharing is used, then several weights may be controlled by a single parameter, \\nand if the parameter is set to zero then all the corresponding weights are deleted. \\nA further possible approach to the design of network topology is to construct \\na complex network from several simpler network modules. We consider two im\\xad\\nportant examples of this, called network committees and mixtures of experts. \\nThe latter allows a problem to be decomposed automatically into a number of \\nsub-problems, each of which is tackled by a separate network. \\n9.5.1 Exact Boolean classification \\nAs we emphasize at several points in this book, the goal in training a neural \\nnetwork is usually to achieve the best generalization on new data rather than to', \"learn the training set accurately. However, for completeness we give here a brief \\nreview of two approaches to network construction algorithms which can learn \\na finite set of Boolean patterns exactly. We consider networks having threshold \\nunits and a single output, for binary input patterns belonging to two classes. \\nBefore discussing these algorithms in detail, we need first to consider a modi\\xad\\nfication to the usual perceptron learning algorithm known as the pocket algorithm \\n(Gallant, 1986b) designed to deal with data sets which are not linearly separable. \\nThe simple perceptron learning algorithm (Section 3.5) is guaranteed to find an \\nexact classification of the training data set if it is linearly separable. If the data \\nset is not linearly separable, then the algorithm does not converge. The pocket \\nalgorithm involves retaining a copy ('in one's pocket') of the set of weights which \\nhas so far survived unchanged for the longest number of pattern presentations. It\", 'can be shown that, for a sufficiently long training time, this gives, with probabil\\xad\\nity arbitrarily close to unity, the set of weight values which produces the smallest 9.5: Growing and pruning algorithms 355 \\no \\no o \\nt O O \\no o \\nx{ xd \\nFigure 9.9. The tiling algorithm builds a network in successive layers. In each \\nlayer, the first unit added is the master unit (shown as the heavier circle) \\nwhich plays a special role. Successive layers are fully connected, and there are \\nno other interconnections in the network. \\npossible number of misclassifications. Note, however, that no upper bound on the \\ntraining time needed for this to occur is known. \\nThe tiling algorithm (Mezard and Nadal, 1989) builds a network in successive \\nlayers with each layer having fewer units than the previous layer, as indicated \\nin Figure 9.9. Note that the only interconnections in the network are between \\nadjacent layers. When a new layer is constructed, a single unit, called the master', \"unit, is added and trained using the pocket algorithm. One requirement for the \\nnetwork is that each layer must form a 'faithful' representation of the data set, \\nin other words two input patterns which belong to different classes must not \\nbe mapped onto the same pattern of activations in any layer, otherwise it will \\nbe impossible for successive layers to separate them. This is achieved by adding \\nfurther ancillary units to the layer, one at a time, leaving the weights to the \\nmaster unit and any other ancillary units in that layer fixed. The geometrical \\ninterpretation of this procedure is indicated in Figure 9.10. If the representation \\nat any stage is not faithful then there must exist patterns from different classes \\nwhich give rise to the same set of activations in that layer. The group of all \\ninput patterns which give rise to those activations are identified and an extra \\nancillary unit is added and trained (again using the pocket algorithm) on that\", 'group. The process of searching for ambiguities, and adding ancillary units, is \\nrepeated until the representation is faithful. The whole process is repeated with \\nthe next layer. It can be shown that at each layer the master unit produces fewer \\nmisclassifications than the master unit in the previous layer. Thus, eventually \\none of the master units produces correct classification of all of the patterns, and \\nso the algorithm converges with a network of finite size. \\nWe next consider the upstart algorithm (Frean, 1990) which is also guaranteed 356 9: Learning and Generalization \\nFigure 9.10. Illustration of the role of the ancillary units in the tiling algo\\xad\\nrithm. The circles and crosses represent the patterns of activations of units in \\na particular layer when the network is presented with input patterns from two \\ndifferent classes. The master unit in the next layer (whose decision boundary is \\nrepresented by the solid line) is trained to And the best linear separator of the', \"classes, and then ancillary units (with decision boundaries given by the dashed \\nlines) are added so as to separate those patterns which are misclassified. \\nto find a finite network which gives complete classification of a finite data set. \\nHowever, it builds the network by adding extra units between existing units \\nand the inputs, as indicated in Figure 9.11. All units take their inputs directly \\nfrom the inputs to the network, and have binary threshold activation functions. \\nThe algorithm begins by training a single unit using the pocket algorithm. This \\n'parent' unit will typically mis-classify some of the patterns, and so two 'offspring' \\nunits are added, one to deal with the patterns for which the parent is incorrectly \\noff, and the other to deal with the patterns for which the parent is incorrectly \\non. These units are connected to their parent with sufficiently large negative and \\npositive weights respectively that they can reverse the output of the parent when\", 'they are activated. The weights to the parent are frozen and the offspring are \\ntrained to produce the correct output for the corresponding incorrect patterns, \\nwhile at the same time not spoiling the classification of the patterns which were \\ncorrect. The algorithm is called upstart because the offspring correct the mistakes \\nof their parents! We can always choose the weights and bias of an offspring unit \\nsuch that it only generates a non-zero output for one particular pattern, and so it \\nwill then reduce the number of errors of the parent by one. In practice, the units \\nare trained by the pocket algorithm and may do much better than just correct \\none pattern. Once trained, the offspring weights are frozen, and they become \\nparents for another layer of offspring, and so on. \\nSince the addition of each offspring unit reduces the number of errors of \\nits parent by at least one, it is clear that the network must eventually classify 9.5: Greu-.r.j ur.j pru:;i;;j ^.yjnir.i:;: Jo7', 'Figure 9.11. The upstart algorithm adds new offspring units, at A and B, \\nto correct the mistakes made by the parent unit. The offspring themselves \\ngenerate offspring units, leading eventually to a network having a binary tree \\nstructure. \\nall patterns correctly using a finite number of units. This occurs because the \\nnumber of mistakes which successive offspring have to correct diminishes until \\neventually an offspring gets all of its patterns correct, which implies that its \\nparent produces the correct patterns, and so on all the way back up the network \\nto the output unit. The final network has the form of a binary tree, although \\nsome branches might be missing if they are not needed. However, this architecture \\ncan be reorganized into a two-layer network by removing the output connections \\nfrom the units and moving all units into a single hidden layer (leaving their input \\nconnections unchanged). A new output unit is then created, and new hidden-to-', 'output connections added. These connections can be learned with the perceptron \\nalgorithm or found by explicit construction in a way which guarantees correct \\nclassification of all patterns (Prean, 1990). In simulations it is found that the \\nupstart algorithm produces networks having fewer units than those found with \\nthe tiling algorithm. Other algorithms for tackling the Boolean classification \\nproblem have been described by Gallant (1986a), Nadal (1989) and Marchand \\net al (1990). \\n9.5.2 Cascade correlation \\nA different approach to network construction, applicable to problems with con\\xad\\ntinuous output variables, is known as cascade-correlation (Fahlman and Lebiere, \\n1990) and is based on networks of sigmoidal hidden units. The form of the net\\xad\\nwork architecture is shown in Figure 9.12. To begin with there are no hidden \\nunits, and every input is connected to every output unit by adjustable con\\xad\\nnections (the crosses in Figure 9.12). The output units may be linear or may', 'have sigmoidal non-linearities depending on the application. At this stage the \\nnetwork has a single layer of weights and can be trained by a number of dif\\xad\\nferent algorithms, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 7. Fahlman and Lebiere use \\nthe quickprop algorithm (Section 7.5.3). The network is trained for a period of \\ntime governed by some user-defined parameter (whose value is set empirically) 358 9: Learning and Generalization \\nhidden „ \\nunits \": \\nH, outputs y, y2 \\no o \\n0— \\nInputs 0--» \\nx2 O- H E* \\nJC, O U 11 \\n& & \\nFigure 9.12.

Squares represent weights which are trained and then frozen, while \\nthe crosses show weights which are retrained after the addition of each hidden \\nunit. Hidden unit Hi is added first, and then hidden unit Hi% and so on. \\nand then a sigmoidal hidden unit is added to the network. This is followed by', 'further network training, alternating with the addition of hidden units, until a \\nsufficiently small error is achieved. The addition of hidden units is done in such \\na way that, at each stage of the algorithm, only a single-layer system is being \\ntrained. Each new hidden unit takes inputs from all of the inputs to the network \\nplus the outputs of all existing hidden units, leading to the cascade structure of \\nFigure 9.12. The hidden unit weights are first determined, and then the unit is \\nadded to the network. These weights are found by maximizing the correlation \\nbetween the output of the unit and the residual error of the network outputs \\nprior to the addition of that unit. This correlation (actually the covariance) is \\ndefined by \\n*=£ Y(z»-z)(e\"k-ek) \\nl (9.62) \\nwhere ejt = (j//t — tk) is the error of network output k, and z denotes the output \\nof the unit given by \\n= 9{Ew<a (9.63) 9.5: Growing and pruning algorithms 359', \"where the sum runs over all inputs and all existing hidden units. In (9.62) the \\nfollowing average quantities are defined over the whole training set \\nn=l n—1 \\nThe derivative of S with respect to the weights of the new hidden unit are easily \\nfound in the form \\n^ = ±EE^-^'< o.65) 1 k n \\nwhere the sign corresponds to the sign of the covariance inside the modulus bars \\nin (9.62). These derivatives can then be used with the quickprop algorithm to \\noptimize the weights for the new hidden unit. Once this has been done the unit \\nis added to the network and is connected to all output units by adaptive weights. \\nAll output-layer weights are now retrained (with all hidden unit weights fixed). \\nAgain, this corresponds to a single-layer training problem, and is performed us\\xad\\ning quickprop. These single-layer training problems can be expected to converge \\nvery rapidly. For linear output units, the output-layer weights, which minimize\", 'a sum-of-squares elrror, can be found quickly by pseudo-inverse techniques (Sec\\xad\\ntion 3.4.3). Note that, because the hidden unit weights are never changed, the \\nactivations of the hidden units (for each of the input vectors from the train\\xad\\ning set) can be evaluated once for the whole of the training set, and these values \\nre-used repeatedly in the remainder of the algorithm, saving considerable compu\\xad\\ntational effort. Benchmark results from this algorithm can be found in Fahlman \\nand Lebiere (1990). \\n9.5.3 Saliency of weights \\nWe turn now to pruning algorithms which start with a relatively large network \\nand then remove connections in order to arrive at a suitable network architec\\xad\\nture. Several of the approaches to network pruning are based on the following \\ngeneral procedure. First, a relatively large network is trained using one of the \\nstandard training algorithms. This network might for instance have a high degree', 'of connectivity. Then the network is examined to assess the relative importance \\nof the weights, and the least important are deleted. Typically this is followed by \\nsome further training of the pruned network, and the procedure of pruning and \\ntraining may be repeated for several cycles. Clearly, there are various choices to \\nbe made concerning how much training is applied at each stage, what fraction \\nof the weights are pruned and so on. Usually these choices are made on a heuris\\xad\\ntic basis. The most important consideration, however, is how to decide which \\nweights should be removed. \\nIn the case of simple models it may be clear in which order the parameters \\nshould be deleted. With a polynomial, for instance, the higher-order coefficients 360 9: Learning and Generalization \\nwould generally be deleted first since we expect the function we are trying to \\nrepresent to be relatively smooth. In the case of a neural network it is not obvious', 'a priori which weights will be the least significant. We therefore need some \\nmeasure of the relative importance, or saliency, of different weights. \\nThe simplest concept of saliency is to suppose that small weights are less \\nimportant than large weights, and to use the magnitude \\\\w\\\\ of a weight value as \\na measure of its importance. Such an approach clearly requires that the input \\nand output variables are normalized appropriately (Section 8.2). However, it \\nhas little theoretical motivation, and performs poorly in practice. We consider \\ninstead how to find a measure of saliency with a more principled justification. \\nSince network training is defined in terms of the minimization of an error func\\xad\\ntion, it is natural to use the same error function to find a definition of saliency. \\nIn particular, we could define the saliency of a weight as the change in the error \\nfunction which results from deletion (setting to zero) of that weight. This could', 'be implemented by direct evaluation, so that, for each weight in the (trained) \\nnetwork in turn, the weight is temporarily set to zero and the error function \\nre-evaluated. However, such an approach would be computationally demanding \\n(Exercise 9.7). \\nConsider instead the change in the error function due to small changes in \\nthe values of the weights (Le Cun et cd., 1990). If the weight t«i is changed to \\nWi + 6wi then the corresponding change in the error function E is given by \\nSE = 52 -Q-6wi + 2 H52Hii6wi6wi + alSw*) (9-66) \\nwhere the Hy are the elements of the Hessian matrix \\n*«=£Li (9-67) \\nIf we assume that the training process has converged, then the first term in \\n(9.66) will vanish. Le Cun et al. (1990) approximate the Hessian by discarding \\nthe non-diagonal terms. Techniques for calculating the diagonal terms of the \\nHessian for a multi-layer perceptron were described in Section 4.10.1. Neglecting \\nthe higher-order terms in the expansion then reduces (9.66) to the form', '6E = ±jTlHii6v#. (9.68) \\nIf a weight having an initial value u>j is set to zero, then the increase in error \\nwill be given approximately by (9.68) with 6wt — tOj, and so the saliency values \\nof the weights are given approximately by the quantities Hawf/2. A practical \\nimplementation would typically consist of the following steps: 9.5: Growing and pruning algorithms 361 \\n1. Choose a relatively large initial network architecture. \\n2. Train the network in the usual way until some stopping criterion is satisfied. \\n3. Compute the second derivatives Ha for each of the weights, and hence \\nevaluate the saliencies Hawf/2. \\n4. Sort the weights by saliency and delete some of the low-saliency weights. \\n5. Go to 2 and repeat until some overall stopping criterion is reached. \\nThis approach to weight elimination has been termed optimal brain damage \\n(Le Cun et al, 1990). In an application to the problem of recognition of hand\\xad', 'written zip codes, the technique allowed the number of free parameters in a \\nnetwork to be reduced by about a factor of 4 (from a network initially hav\\xad\\ning over 10 000 free parameters) while giving a small increase in generalization \\nperformance and a substantial increase in the speed of the trained network. \\nThe assumption that the Hessian for a network is diagonal, however, is fre\\xad\\nquently a poor one. A procedure for determining the saliency of weights, known \\nas optimal brain surgeon, which does not make the assumption of a diagonal Hes\\xad\\nsian, was introduced by Hassibi and Stork (1993). This method also computes \\ncorrections to the remaining weights after deletion of a particular weight and \\nso reduces the need for network retraining during the pruning phase. Suppose \\na weight uij is to be set to zero. The remaining weights are then adjusted so as \\nto minimize the increase in error resulting from the deletion. We can write the', 'total change in the weight vector in the form <5w. Again, assuming the network \\nis already trained to a minimum of the error function, and neglecting third-order \\nterms, the change in the error resulting from this change to the weight vector \\ncan be written \\n6E = ^(5wTH<5w. (9.69) \\nThe change in the weight vector must satisfy \\nej6w + Wi = 0 (9.70) \\nwhere e* is a unit vector in weight space parallel to the Wj axis. We need to \\nfind the <5w which minimizes 6E in (9.69), subject to the constraint (9.70). \\nThis is most easily done by introducing a Lagrange multiplier (Exercise 9.8 and \\nAppendix C), giving the following result for the optimal change in the weight \\nvector \\n«w = -T^irH-1ei (9.71) \\nl\" In \\nand the corresponding value for the increase in the error in the form \\n6Ei-lwk- (9-72) 362 9: Learning and Generalization \\nFigure 9.13. A schematic illustration of the error contours for a network having \\na non-diagonal Hessian matrix, for two of the weights w\\\\ and W2- The network', 'is initially trained to the error minimum at w*. Weight pruning based on the \\nmagnitude of the weights would take the weight vector to the point A by \\nelimination of the smaller weight wi. Conversely, optimal brain damage leads \\nto removal of w\\\\ and moves the weight vector to B. Finally, optimal brain \\nsurgeon removes wt and also computes a correction to the remaining weight \\n»2 and hence moves the weight vector to C. \\nNote that, if the Hessian is in fact diagonal, then these results reduce to the \\ncorresponding results for the optimal brain damage technique discussed above. \\nThe inverse Hessian is evaluated using the sequential technique discussed in \\nSection 4.10.3 which is itself based on the outer product approximation for the \\nHessian, discussed in Section 4.10.2. In a practical implementation, the optimal \\nbrain surgeon algorithm proceeds by the following steps: \\n1. Train a relatively large network to a minimum of the error function. \\n2. Evaluate the inverse Hessian H_1.', '3. Evaluate 6Ei for each value of i using (9.72) and select the value of i which \\ngives the smallest increase in error. \\n4. Update all of the weights in the network using the weight change evaluated \\nfrom (9.71). \\n5. Go to 3 and repeat until some stopping criterion is reached. \\nA comparison of pruning by weight magnitude, optimal brain damage and opti\\xad\\nmal brain surgeon is shown schematically in Figure 9.13. Note that the weight \\nchanges are evaluated in the quadratic approximation. Since the true error func\\xad\\ntion will be non-quadratic, it will be necessary to retrain the network after a \\nperiod of weight pruning. Simulation results confirm that the optimal brain sur\\xad\\ngeon technique is superior to optimal brain damage which is in turn superior to \\nmagnitude-based pruning (Le Cun et al., 1990; Hassibi and Stork, 1993). 9.5: Growing and pruning algorithms 363 \\n9.5.4 Weight elimination \\nIn Section 9.2.1 we discussed the use of a simple weight-decay term as a form of', 'regularization, to give a total error function of the form \\nE = E+^wl (9.73) \\nThis regularization term favours small weights, and so network training based on \\nminimization of (9.73) will tend to reduce the magnitude of those weights which \\nare not contributing significantly to a reduction in the error E. One procedure for \\npruning weights from a network would therefore be to train the network using \\nthe regularized error (9.73), and then remove weights whose values fall below \\nsome threshold. \\nOne of the difficulties of the simple penalty term in (9.73), from the point of \\nview of network pruning, is that it tends to favour many small weights rather \\nthan a few large ones. To see this, consider two weights Wi and u>2 feeding \\ninto a unit from identical inputs, so that the weights are performing redundant \\ntasks. The unregularized error E will be identical if we have two equal weights \\nWi = wi = w/2, or if we have one larger weight W\\\\ = w, and one zero weight', \"W2 = 0. In the first case, the weight-decay term YJIW1 — w2/2 while in the \\nsecond case Y^iw1 .= w2-\\nThis problem can be overcome by using a modified decay term of the form \\n(Hanson and Pratt, 1989; Lang and Hinton, 1990; Weigend et al, 1990) \\n2 \\nE = E + vY ^7 2 (9-74) \\n^ w2 + w2 ' \\nwhere wis a parameter which sets a scale and is usually chosen to be of order \\nunity. Use of this form of regularizer has been called weight elimination. As shown \\nin Exercise 9.9, for weight values somewhat larger than w this penalty term will \\ntend favour a few large weights rather than many small ones, and so is more \\nlikely to eliminate weights from the network than is the simple weight-decay \\nterm in (9.73). This leads to a form of network pruning which is combined with \\nthe training process itself, rather than alternating with it. In practice weight \\nvalues will typically not be reduced to zero, but it would be possible to remove\", 'weights completely if their values fell below some small threshold. Note that this \\nalgorithm involves the scale parameter w whose value must be chosen by hand. \\n9.5.5 Node pruning \\nInstead of pruning individual weights from a network we can prune complete \\nunits, and several techniques for achieving this have been suggested. Mozer and \\nSmolensky (1989) adopt an algorithm based on alternate phases of training and \\nremoval of units. This requires a measure of the saliency st of a unit, of which \\nthe most natural definition would be the increase in the error function (measured 364 9: Learning and Generalization \\nwith respect to the training set) as a result of deleting a unit j \\nSj = ^(without unit j) — E(v/ith unit j). (9.75) \\nAs with individual weights, such a measure is relatively slow to evaluate since it \\nrequires a complete pass through the data set for each unit, although it is clearly \\nless computationally expensive to repeat the error measurement for each unit', 'than it is for each weight. To find a convenient approximation, we can introduce \\na factor a.,- which multiplies the summed input to each unit (except the output \\nunits), so that the forward propagation equations become \\nI Ctj ]T WjiZi (9.76) \\nwhere the activation function g(-) is defined such that g(Q) = 0, as would be the \\ncase for g(a) = tanha, for example. Then with ctj = 0 the unit is absent, and \\nwith Qj = 1 the unit is present. Then (9.75) can be written as \\nSj = E(otj = 1) - E(<XJ = 0) (9.77) \\nwhich can then be approximated by the derivative with respect to ctj: \\ndE \\nSj~ daj (9.78) \\nThese derivatives are easily evaluated using an extension of the back-propagation \\nalgorithm (Exercise 9.10). Note that the a,- do not actually appear in the forward \\npropagation equations, but are introduced simply as a convenient way to define, \\nand evaluate, the Sj. In order to make this approach work in practice, Mozer \\nand Smolensky (1989) found they had to use a Minkowski-R error with R = 1', '(Section 6.2), together with an exponentially weighted running average estimate \\nof Sj to smooth out fluctuations. Other forms of node-pruning algorithm have \\nbeen considered by Hanson and Pratt (1989), Chauvin (1989) and Ji et al. (1990). \\n9.6 Committees of networks \\nIt is common practice in the application of neural networks to train many differ\\xad\\nent candidate networks and then to select the best, on the basis of performance \\non an independent validation set for instance, and to keep only this network and \\nto discard the rest. There are two disadvantages with such an approach. First, \\nall of the effort involved in training the remaining networks is wasted. Second, \\nthe generalization performance on the validation set has a random component \\ndue to the noise on the data, and so the network which had best performance on 9.6: Committees of networks 365 \\nthe validation set might not be the one with the best performance on new test \\ndata.', 'These drawbacks can be overcome by combining the networks together to \\nform a committee (Perrone and Cooper, 1993; Perrone, 1994). The importance of \\nsuch an approach is that it can lead to significant improvements in the predictions \\non new data, while involving little additional computational effort. In fact the \\nperformance of a committee can be better than the performance of the best single \\nnetwork used in isolation. For notational convenience we consider networks with a \\nsingle output y, although the generalization to several outputs is straightforward. \\nSuppose we have a set of L trained network models j/j(x) where i = 1,... ,L. \\nThis set might contain networks having different numbers of hidden units, or \\nnetworks with the same architecture but trained to different local minima of \\nthe error function. It might even include different kinds of network models or \\na mixture of network and conventional models. We denote the true regression', 'function which we are seeking to approximate by h(x). Then we can write the \\nmapping function of each network as the desired function plus an error: \\ntt(x) = h(x) + £i(x). (9.79) \\nThe average sum-of-squares error for model «/j(x) can be written as \\nEi = £[{Vi(x) - fc(x)}2] = €\\\\t\\\\\\\\ (9.80) \\nwhere £[•] denotes the expectation, and corresponds to an integration over x \\nweighted by the unconditional density of x so that \\n£[£?]= y£?(x)p(x)dx. (9.81) \\nFrom (9.80) the average error made by the networks acting individually is given \\nby \\nE™ = ifiEi = ±Yd£[€}}. (9.82) \\nWe now introduce a simple form of committee. This involves taking the out\\xad\\nput of the committee to be the average of the outputs of the L networks which \\ncomprise the committee. Thus, we write the committee prediction in the form \\n1 L \\nVCOM(X) = -£5>(X). (9.83) \\ni=l \\nThe error due to the committee can then be written as 366 9: Learning and Generalization \\nEcOM = £ J 5Z^W - h(x) \\n&j (9.84)', \"If we now make the assumption that the errors ej(x) have zero mean and are \\nuncorrelated, so that \\n£[ei}=0, £[uej]=° i{ J * * (9.85) \\nthen, using (9.82), we can relate the committee error (9.84) to the average error \\nof the networks acting separately as follows: \\n-ScoM = jz Yl^ iei] ~ T^AV- (9.86) \\nThis represents the apparently rather dramatic result that the sum-of-squares \\nerror can be reduced by a factor of L simply by averaging the predictions of \\nL networks. In practice, the reduction in error is generally much smaller than \\nthis, because the errors e^(x) of different models are typically highly correlated, \\nand so assumption (9.85) does not hold. However, we can easily show that the \\ncommittee averaging process cannot produce an increase in the expected error \\nby making use of Cauchy's inequality in the form \\nwhich gives the result £« ^L£< (9.87) \\n£cOM < EAy. (9.88) \\nTypically, some useful reduction in error is generally obtained, and the method\", 'has the advantage of being trivial to implement. There is a significant reduction \\nin processing speed for new data, but in many applications this will be irrelevant. \\nThe reduction in error can be viewed as arising from reduced variance due \\nto the averaging over many solutions. This suggests that the members of the \\ncommittee should not individually be chosen to have optimal trade-off between \\nbias and variance, but should have relatively smaller bias, since the extra variance \\ncan be removed by averaging. \\nThe simple committee discussed so far involves averaging the predictions of \\nthe individual networks. However, we might expect that some members of the \\ncommittee will typically make better predictions than other members. We would \\ntherefore expect to be able to reduce the error still further if we give greater \\nweight to some committee members than to others. Thus, we consider a gener- 9.6: Committees of networks 367', 'alized committee prediction given by a weighted combination of the predictions \\nof the members of the form \\n2/GEN(X) = ^Qiy<(x) (9.89) \\n«=i \\n= /i(x) + ^ai£i(x) (9.90) \\ni=i \\nwhere the parameters a* will be determined shortly.

Furthermore, since this term is strictly negative, we can use \\n(9.80), (9.82) and (9.102), together with a* = l/L, to give \\nEGEN < EAV (9.103) \\nin keeping with (9.88) and (9.101).', 'One problem with the constraint (9.95) is that it does not prevent the weight\\xad\\ning coefficients in the committee from adopting large negative and positive values \\nand hence giving extreme predictions from the committee even when each mem\\xad\\nber of the committee might be making sensible predictions.

The minimization of the \\ncommittee error subject to these two constraints is now a more difficult problem, \\nand can be tackled using techniques of linear programming (Press et al., 1992). \\nThe usefulness of committee averaging is not limited to the sum-of-squares \\nerror, but applies to any error function which is convex (Exercise 9.13). Sec\\xad\\ntion 10.7 shows how the concept of a committee arises naturally in a Bayesian \\nframework.', \"9.7 Mixtures of experts \\nConsider the problem of learning a mapping in which the form of the mapping is \\ndifferent for different regions of the input space. Although a single homogeneous \\nnetwork could be applied to this problem, we might expect that the task would \\nbe made easier if we assigned different 'expert' networks to tackle each of the \\ndifferent regions, and then used an extra 'gating' network, which also sees the \\ninput vector, to decide which of the experts should be used to determine the \\noutput. \\nIf the problem has an obvious decomposition of this form, then it may be \\npossible to design the network architecture by hand.

The error function is given by the negative logarithm of the \\nlikelihood with respect to a probability distribution given by a mixture of M \\nGaussians of the form \\nM \\n£ = -ElniEa\\'(x\"^(tn!xn) (9.104)', 'where the <fo(t|x) are Gaussian functions given by \\n*<(t|x) (27r)c/2 exp p-y>ll3}. (9.105) \\nThese Gaussian functions have means (Xj(x) which are functions of the input \\nvector x, and are taken to have unit covariance matrices.

First, the variance parameters of the Gaussians here are set \\nto unity, whereas they were taken to be general functions of the input vector x \\nin Section 6.4, although is it clearly straightforward to incorporate more general', 'Gaussian functions into the present model. Second, different networks are used \\nto model the ^i(x) and a*(x) here, whereas a single network was considered in \\nSection 6.4. \\nThe mixture-of-experts network is trained by minimizing the error function \\n(9.104) simultaneously with respect to the weights in all of the expert networks \\nand in the gating network. When the trained network is used to make predictions \\nfor new inputs, the input vector is presented to the gating network and the largest \\noutput is used to select one of the expert networks. The input vector is then \\npresented to this expert network whose output ^(x) represents the prediction \\nof the complete system for this input. This corresponds to the selection of the \\nmost probable branch of the conditional distribution on the assumption of weakly \\noverlapping Gaussians, as discussed on page 220. \\nIt was also shown in Section 6.4 that the use of an error function based on a', 'mixture of Gaussians leads to an automatic soft clustering of the target vectors \\ninto groups associated with the Gaussian components. In the context of the \\nmixture-of-experts architecture it therefore leads to an automatic decomposition \\nof the problem into distinct sub-tasks, each of which is effectively assigned to \\none of the network modules. \\nJacobs et dl. (1991) demonstrate the performance of this algorithm on a \\nvowel recognition problem and show that it discovers a sensible decomposition \\nof the mapping. Jordan and Jacobs (1994) extend the mixture-of-experts model \\nby considering a hierarchical system in which each expert network can itself \\nconsist of a mixture-of-experts model complete with its own gating network. \\nThis can be repeated at any number of levels, leading to a tree structure. The \\nhierarchical architecture then allows simple linear networks to be used for the \\nexperts at the leaves of the tree, while still allowing the overall system to have', 'flexible modelling capabilities. Jordan and Jacobs (1994) have shown that the \\nEM algorithm (Section 2.6.2) can be extended to provide an effective training \\nmechanism for such networks. \\n9.8 Model order selection \\nIn this book, we have focused on the minimization of an error function as the \\nbasic technique for determining values for the free parameters (the weights and \\nbiases) in a neural network. Such an approach, however, is unable to determine \\nthe optimum number of such parameters (or equivalently the optimum size of \\nnetwork), because an increase in the number of parameters in a network will \\ngenerally allow a smaller value of the error to be found. Our goal is to find a \\nnetwork which gives good predictions for new data, and this is typically not \\nthe network which gives the smallest error with respect to the training data. In \\nthe trade-off between bias and variance discussed in Section 9.1, we saw that', 'there is an optimal degree of complexity in a network model for a given data \\nset. Networks with too little flexibility will smooth out some of the underlying 372 9: Learning and Generalization \\nstructure in the data (corresponding to high bias), while networks which are too \\ncomplex will over-fit the data (corresponding to high variance). In either case, \\nthe performance of the network on new data will be poor. \\nSimilar considerations apply to the problem of determining the values of \\ncontinuous parameters such as the regularization coefficient v in a regularized \\nerror function of the form \\nE = E + vSl. (9.107) \\nToo large a value for v leads to a network with large bias (unless the regulariza\\xad\\ntion function happens to be completely consistent with the underlying structure \\nof the data) while too small a value allows the network solution to have too \\nhigh a variance. This was illustrated in Figures 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6. Again, direct', 'minimization of E cannot be used to find the optimum value for v, since this \\ngives v = 0 and an over-fitted solution. \\nWe shall assume that the goal is to find a network having the best general\\xad\\nization performance. This is usually the most difficult part of any pattern recog\\xad\\nnition problem, and is the one which typically limits the practical application of \\nneural networks. In some cases, however, other criteria might also be important. \\nFor instance, speed of operation on a serial computer will be governed by the \\nsize of the network, and we might be prepared to trade some generalization ca\\xad\\npability in return for a smaller network. We shall not discuss these possibilities \\nfurther, but instead focus exclusively on the problem of generalization. \\n9.8.1 Cross-validation \\nSince our goal is to find the network having the best performance on new data, \\nthe simplest approach to the comparison of different networks is to evaluate the', 'error function using data which is independent of that used for training. Various \\nnetworks are trained by minimization of an appropriate error function defined \\nwith respect to a training data set. The performance of the networks is then \\ncompared by evaluating the error function using an independent validation set, \\nand the network having the smallest error with respect to the validation set \\nis selected. This approach is called the hold out method. Since this procedure \\ncan itself lead to some over-fitting to the validation set, the performance of the \\nselected network should be confirmed by measuring its performance on a third \\nindependent set of data called a test set. \\nThe application of this technique is illustrated in Figure 9.15 using the same \\nradial basis function example as used in plotting Figures 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6. Here \\nwe have plotted the error on the training set, as well as the generalization error', 'measured with respect to an independent validation set, as functions of the \\nlogarithm of the regularization coefficient v. As expected, the training error \\ndecreases steadily with decreasing v while the validation error shows a minimum \\nat a value of \\\\xiv ~ 3.7, and thereafter increases with decreasing v.

Each trained network is then tested on the data from the segment which \\nwas omitted during training, and the results averaged over all S networks. \\nscarce we could go to the extreme limit of S = A^ for a data set with N data \\npoints, which involves N separate training runs per network, each using (N — 1) \\ndata points. This limit is known as the leave-one-out method. \\n9.8.2 Stacked generalization \\nIn Section 9.6 we discussed the use of committees as a way of combining the pre\\xad\\ndictions of several trained networks, and we saw how this could lead to reduced \\nerrors. The committee techniques are based only on the training data, however, \\nand so do not directly address the issue of model complexity optimization. Con\\xad', \"versely, techniques such as cross-validation represent a winner-takes-all strategy \\nin which only the best network is retained. The method of stacked generalization \\n(Wolpert, 1992) provides a way of combining trained networks together which \\nuses partitioning of the data set (in a similar way to cross-validation) to find an \\noverall system with usually improved generalization performance. \\nConsider the modular network system shown in Figure 9.18. Here we see a set \\nof M 'level-0' networks N® to A/^ whose outputs are combined using a 'level-1'' \\nnetwork A/1. The idea is to train the level-0 networks first and then examine their \\nbehaviour when generalizing. This provides a new training set which is used to \\ntrain the level-1 network. \\nThe specific procedure for setting up the stacked generalization system is as \\nfollows. Let the complete set of available data be denoted by D. We first leave \\naside a single data point from D as a validation point, and treat the remainder\", \"of D as a training set. All level-0 networks are then trained using the training \\npartition and their outputs are measured using the validation data point. This \\ngenerates a single pattern for a new data set which will be used to train the \\nlevel-1 network Af1. The inputs of this pattern consist of the outputs of all the \\nlevel-0 networks, and the target value is the corresponding target value from the \\noriginal full data set. This process is now repeated with a different choice for 376 9: Learning and Generalization \\nFigure 9.18. Stacked generalization combines the outputs of several 'level-O' \\nnetworks •A/?,... ,MM using a 'level-l' network Af1 to give the final output. \\nThe level-l network corrects for the biases exhibited by the level-0 networks. \\nthe data point which is kept aside. After cycling through the full data set of \\nN points we have N patterns in the new data set, which is now used to train\", 'Ml. Finally, all of the level-0 networks are re-trained using the full data set D. \\nPredictions on new data can now be made by presenting new input vectors to the \\nlevel-0 networks and taking their outputs as the inputs to the level-l network, \\nwhose output constitutes the predicted output. Wolpert (1992) gives arguments \\nto suggest that the level-0 networks should contain a wide variety of different \\nmodels, while the level-l network should provide a relatively smooth function \\nand hence should have a relatively simple structure. \\nThere are many possible variations of stacked generalization. For instance, if \\nthe data set is large, or if the level-0 networks are computationally intensive to \\ntrain, we might leave aside a larger fraction of D than just a single data point \\nwhen training the level-0 networks. Stacking can also be applied in a slightly \\nmodified form to improve the generalization of a single network, and it can also', 'be extended to more than two levels of networks (Wolpert, 1992). \\n9.8.3 Complexity criteria \\nIn conventional statistics, various criteria have been developed, often in the con\\xad\\ntext of linear models, for assessing the generalization performance of trained \\nmodels without the use of validation data. These include the Cp-statistic (Mal\\xad\\nlows, 1973), the final prediction error (Akaike, 1969), the Akaike information \\ncriterion (Akaike, 1973) and the predicted squared error (Barron, 1984). Such \\ncriteria take the general form of a prediction error (PE) which consists of the \\nsum of two terms \\nPE = training error + complexity term (9.111) \\nwhere the complexity term represents a penalty which grows as the number of \\nfree parameters in the model grows. Thus, if the model is too simple it will give \\na large value for the criterion because the residual training error is large, while a 9.9: Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension 377', 'model which is too complex will have a large value for the criterion because the \\ncomplexity term is large. The minimum value for the criterion then represents \\na trade-off between these two competing effects. For a sum-of-squares error a \\ntypical form for such a criterion would be \\nPE==¥ + ir*a <9-112> \\nwhere E is the value of the sum-of-squares error with respect to the training set \\nafter training is complete, N is the total number of data points in the training \\nset, W is the number of adjustable parameters (weights) in the model, and a2 is \\nthe variance of the noise on the data (which must be estimated). \\nMoody (1992) has generalized such criteria to deal with non-linear models \\nand to allow for the presence of a regularization term. By performing a local \\nlinearization of the network mapping function he obtains a criterion, called the \\ngeneralized prediction error, of the form \\nGPE = ^ + ^a2 (9.113) \\nwhere 7 is the effective number of parameters in the network, which for linear', 'networks is given by \\n7 = V_^ (9.114) \\nwhere A, are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the unregularized error \\nevaluated at the error minimum, and u is the regularization coefficient. The \\nform of 7 in (9.114) should be compared to the expression for the minimum of \\nthe regularized error given by (9.24). The reason that 7 is the effective number \\nof parameters is that eigenvalues which satisfy \\\\ ~S> u contribute 1 to the sum \\nin (9.114), while eigenvalues which satisfy Aj <C v contribute 0 to the sum. We \\nshall not discuss the origin of this criterion here, since we give a more general \\ndiscussion from the Bayesian perspective in Chapter 10. \\n9.9 Vapnik—Chervonenkis dimension \\nSome useful insight into generalization is obtained by considering the worst-\\ncase performance for a particular trained network. The theory of this has been \\ndeveloped mainly in the context of networks with binary inputs (Baum and', 'Haussler, 1989; Abu-Mostafa, 1989; Hertz et al., 1991). For simplicity we consider \\nnetworks having a single binary output. \\nSuppose that the input vectors are generated from some probability distri\\xad\\nbution P(x) and that the target data is given by a (noiseless) function /i(x). For \\nany given model y(x), we can define the average generalization ability g(y) to 378 9: Learning and Generalization \\nbe the probability that j/(x) = h(x) for the given distribution P(x). This says \\nthat, if we pick an input vector x at random from the distribution P(x), then \\nthe probability that the two functions will agree is given by g(y). \\nIn practice, we cannot calculate g(y) directly because we do not know the \\ntrue probability distribution -P(x), nor do we know the function h(x). What we \\ntypically do instead is to train a network using a set of N training patterns to \\ngive a network function j/(x; w), and then measure the fraction of the training', 'set which the network correctly classifies, which we shall denote by gjv(y). In \\nthe limit of an infinite data set N -* oo we would expect to find gr<r(y) —* g(y), \\nby definition of g{y). However, for a finite-size training set the network func\\xad\\ntion y(x; w) will be partly tuned to the particular training set (the problem of \\nover-fitting) and so we would expect gn(y) > <?(?/)• For instance, the network \\nmight learn the training set perfectly, so that gN(y) — 1, and yet the predictive \\nperformance on new data drawn from the same distribution might be poor so \\nthat g(y) -C 1. We say that gN(y) is a biased estimate of g(y), since it is system\\xad\\natically different from the true value. It gives an over-optimistic estimate of the \\ngeneralization performance of the network. \\nIf we now consider the set of all functions {y} which the network can im\\xad\\nplement, we can study the maximum discrepancy which can occur between the', 'generalization performance estimated from the sample of size N and the true \\ngeneralization g(y), given by \\nmax\\\\gN(y) - g(y)\\\\ (9.115) \\nM \\nas this gives a worst-case measure of generalization performance. Given a small \\nquantity e, a theorem due to Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) gives an upper \\nbound on the probability of the difference in (9.115) exceeding e, given by \\nPr (mt>x\\\\gN(y) -g(y)\\\\ > ej < 4A(2Ar)exp(-e27V/8) (9.116) \\nwhere A(N) is known as the growth function and will be discussed shortly. \\nSince this result applies to any of the functions y which can be implemented \\nby the network, we can apply it to the particular function y(x; w) obtained from \\ntraining the network on the given data set. Then (9.116) gives an upper bound \\non the discrepancy between our estimate g^iy) of the prediction error and the \\ntrue generalization performance g(y). Our aim is to make this bound as small as \\npossible (i.e. make the right-hand side of (9.116) as small as possible), and we', 'can seek to do this by increasing the number JV of training patterns. Suppose \\nfor instance that we obtained perfect results (zero residual error) on the training \\ndata, so that grf(y) = 1. Then, for a given value of e if we could reduce the right-\\nhand side of (9.116) to a small value 6 = 0.05, say, we would be 95% certain that \\ng(y) > i - e-\\nThe function A(7V) in (9.116) gives the number of distinct binary functions 9.9: Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension 379 \\nlog2A \\nFigure 9.19. General form of the growth function A(TV) shown as a plot of \\nlog2 A versus N. The function initially grows like 2N up to some critical num\\xad\\nber of patterns, given by N — dvc, at which point the growth slows to become \\na power law. The value dvc is called the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. \\n(dichotomies) which can be implemented by the network on a set of TV input \\nvectors xn, where n = l,...,N. The number of potential different patterns is', '2N, and if our network could represent all of these then A(TV) = 2N. In this \\ncase, it is clear that we cannot make the right-hand side of (9.116) smaller by \\nincreasing TV. In practice, our network will have a finite capacity, and so for \\nlarge enough TV it will not be capable of representing all possible 2N patterns. \\nThe general form of the function A(TV) is shown in Figure 9.19. For small TV it \\ngrows like 2^, which says that the network can store exactly all of the training \\npatterns. Beyond some critical number of patterns, however, the growth starts to \\nslow down. This critical number of patterns, denoted dvc, is called the Vapnik-\\nChervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension (Blumer et ai, 1989; Abu-Mostafa, \\n1989) and is a property of the particular network. In fact, it can be shown \\n(Cover, 1965; Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971) that the function A(TV) is either \\nidentically equal to 2N for all TV, or is bounded above by the relation \\nA(TV) < Ndvc + 1. (9.117)', 'Since this now has only polynomial growth, it is clear that we can make the \\nright-hand side of (9.116) arbitrarily small by making TV sufficiently large. This \\nis an intuitively reasonable result. If there are so few patterns that the network \\ncan store them all perfectly, we cannot expect it to generalize. Only when the \\nnetwork has successfully learned a number of patterns which is much larger than \\nits intrinsic storage capacity for random patterns (as measured by dvc) will the \\nnetwork have captured some of the structure in the data, and only then can \\nwe expect it to generalize to new data. Consider a set of data points which are \\ngenerated at random. The only way to learn all of the patterns in such a data \\nset is for the network to store the training patterns individually, which requires \\na network with dye > N- For such data sets we cannot expect to find a network 380 9: Learning and Generalization \\nwhich generalizes.', 'The above results give us some idea of how many patterns we need to use to \\ntrain a network in order to get good generalization performance in terms of the \\nVC dimension of the network. Baum and Haussler (1989) considered multi-layer \\nfeed-forward networks of threshold units. For a network having a total of M \\nunits, and a total of W weights (including biases), they gave an upper bound on \\nthe VC dimension in the form \\ndvc < 2Wlog2(eM) (9.118) \\nwhere e is the base of natural logarithms. They used this to show that, if some \\nnumber N of patterns, given by \\nAT>-^log2(M (9.119) \\ncan be learned by the network such that a fraction 1 — e/2 are correctly classified, \\nwhere 0 < e < 1/8, then there is a high probability that the network will correctly \\nclassify a fraction 1 — e of future examples drawn from the same distribution. \\nThey also considered the case of networks having two layers of threshold \\nunits, and were able to find a lower bound on the VC dimension in the form', 'dye > 2[M/2jd . (9.120) \\nwhere [M/2] denotes the largest integer which is less than or equal to M/2, \\nand d is the number of inputs. For large two-layer networks we typically have \\nMd ~ W (since most of the weights are in the first layer). From this they derived \\nthe approximate rule of thumb that to classify correctly a fraction 1 — e of new \\nexamples requires a number of patterns at least equal to \\n2V.au. * W/e. (9.121) \\nThus, for e = 0.1 this suggests that we need around ten times as many training \\npatterns as there are weights in the network. \\nThe VC dimension gives worst-case bounds on generalization. In particular, \\nit only considers which functions can in principle be implemented by the net\\xad\\nwork. Thus, it does not depend, for instance, on the presence or absence of a \\nregularizing function, since such a function does not completely rule out any set \\nof weight values. We might hope that in practice we would achieve good gener\\xad', \"alization with fewer training patterns than the number predicted using the VC \\ndimension. \\nExercises \\n9.1 (**) Consider a quadratic error function of the form Exercises 381 \\n£ = £0 + ^(w-w*)TH(w-w*) (9.122) \\nwhere w* represents the minimum, and the Hessian matrix H is positive \\ndefinite and constant.

The above results also show that \\nthe effective number of parameters in the network, as defined by (9.114), \\ngrows as the training progresses. \\n9.2 (*) Consider a linear network model with outputs \\nVk - ]P wkiXi + wk0 (9.128) \\ni \\nand a sum-of-squares error function of the form \\nrt=l fc \\nwhere n labels the patterns from the training set, and t% denotes the target \\nvalues.

A simple example of the Bayesian approach was described in \\nSection 2.3 where we considered the problem of inferring the mean of a one-\", 'dimensional Gaussian distribution from a set of training data. In the context of \\nneural networks, Bayesian methods offer a number of important features includ\\xad\\ning the following: \\n1. The conventional training method of error minimization arises from a par\\xad\\nticular approximation to the Bayesian approach. \\n2. Regularization can be given a natural interpretation in the Bayesian frame\\xad\\nwork. \\n3. For regression problems, error bars, or confidence intervals, can be assigned \\nto the predictions generated by a network. \\n4. Bayesian methods allow the values of regularization coefficients to be se\\xad\\nlected using only the training data, without the need to use separate train\\xad\\ning and validation data. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach allows rela\\xad\\ntively large numbers of regularization coefficients to be used, which would \\nbe computationally prohibitive if their values had to be optimized using \\ncross-validation. \\n5. Similarly, the Bayesian approach allows different models (e.g. networks', 'with different numbers of hidden units, or different network types such as \\nmulti-layer perceptrons and radial basis function networks) to be compared \\nusing only the training data. More generally, it provides an objective and \\nprincipled framework for dealing with the issues of model complexity which \\navoids many of the problems which arise when using maximum likelihood. \\n6. Bayesian methods allow choices to be made about where in input space new \\ndata should be collected in order that it be the most informative (MacKay, \\n1992c). Such use of the model itself to guide the collection of data during \\ntraining is known as active learning. \\n7. The relative importance of different inputs can be determined using the \\nBayesian technique of automatic relevance determination (MacKay, 1994a, \\n1995b; Neal, 1994), based on the use of a separate regularization coeffi\\xad\\ncient for each input. If a particular coefficient acquires a large value, this', 'indicates that the corresponding input is irrelevant and can be eliminated. 386 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nNote that, in order to focus on the more basic issues, topics 6 and 7 will not be \\ndiscussed further. \\nIn earlier chapters network training was based on maximum likelihood which \\nis equivalent to minimization of an error function. We emphasized that, within \\nthis framework, a more complex model is typically better able to fit the training \\ndata, but that this does not necessarily mean that it will give a smaller error \\nwith respect to new data. Models which are either too simple or too complex \\nwill give relatively poor approximations to the underlying process from which \\nthe data is generated. This was discussed in terms of the bias-variance trade\\xad\\noff in Section 9.1. It is therefore not clear, from the training error alone, which \\nmodel will give the best generalization, and so we resorted to partitioning of the', \"data set to select an appropriate level of complexity, through such techniques \\nas cross-validation (Section 9.8.1). The Bayesian approach, however, treats the \\nissue of model complexity very differently, and in particular it allows all of the \\navailable data to be used for 'training'. \\nTo gain some insight into how this comes about, consider a hypothetical ex\\xad\\nample of three different models, Hi, H% and H3, which we suppose have steadily \\nincreasing flexibility, corresponding for instance to a steadily increasing number \\nof hidden units. Thus, each model consists of a specification of the network archi\\xad\\ntecture (number of units, type of activation function, etc.) and is governed by a \\nnumber of adaptive parameters. By varying the values of these parameters, each \\nmodel can represent a range of input-output functions. The more complex mod\\xad\\nels, with a greater number of hidden units for instance, can represent a greater\", \"range of such functions. Suppose we have a set of input vectors (x1,..., x.N), and \\na corresponding set of target vectors D = (t1,..., tN). We can then consider the \\nposterior probability for each of the models, given the observed data set D. From \\nBayes' theorem this probability can be written in the form \\nrfW) = E<£^p. (10.i) \\nThe quantity p(Ki) represents a prior probability for model Hi. If we have no \\nparticular reason to prefer one model over another, then we would assign equal \\npriors to all of the models. Since the denominator p(D) does not depend on \\nthe model, we see that different models can be compared by evaluating p(D\\\\Hi), \\nwhich is called the evidence for the model Hi (MacKay, 1992a). This is illustrated \\nschematically in Figure 10.1, where we see that the evidence favours models which \\nare neither too simple nor too complex. \\nThis indicates that the Bayesian approach could be used to select a particular\", 'model for which the evidence is largest. We might expect that the model with \\nthe greatest evidence is also the one which will have the best generalization per\\xad\\nformance, and we shall discuss this issue in some detail in Section 10.6. However, \\nas we shall see in Section 10.7, the correct Bayesian approach is to make use of \\nthe complete set of models. Predicted outputs for new input vectors are obtained 10.1: Bayesian learning of network weights 387 \\nFigure 10.1. Schematic example of three models, Hi, H2 and H3, which have \\nsuccessively greater complexity, showing the probability (known as the evi\\xad\\ndence) of different data sets D given each model Hi. We see that more com\\xad\\nplex models can describe a greater range of data sets. Note, however, that the \\ndistributions are normalized. Thus, when a particular data set Do is observed, \\nthe model Hi has a greater evidence than either the simpler model H\\\\ or the \\nmore complex model W3.', 'by performing a weighted sum over the predictions of all the models, where the \\nweighting coefficients depend on the evidence. More probable models therefore \\ncontribute more strongly to the predicted output. Since the evidence can be \\nevaluated using the training data, we see that Bayesian methods are able to deal \\nwith the issue of model complexity, without the need to use cross-validation. \\nAn important concept in Bayesian inference is that of marginalization, which \\ninvolves integrating out unwanted variables. Suppose we are discussing a model \\nwith two variables w and a. Then the most complete description of these variables \\nis in terms of the joint distribution p(w,a). If we are interested only in the \\ndistribution of w then we should integrate out a as follows: \\np(w) = / p(w,a)da \\n= p(w\\\\a)p(a) da. (10.2) \\nThus the predictive distribution for w is obtained by averaging the conditional \\ndistribution p(w\\\\a) with a weighting factor given by the distribution p{a). We', \"shall encounter several examples of marginalization later in this chapter. \\n10.1 Bayesian learning of network weights \\nThe first problem we shall address is that of learning the weights in a neural \\nnetwork on the basis of a set of training data. In previous chapters we have \\nused maximum likelihood techniques (equivalent to the minimization of an error 388 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nfunction) which attempt to find a single set of values for the network weights. \\nBy contrast, the Bayesian approach considers a probability distribution function \\nover weight space, representing the relative degrees of belief in different values \\nfor the weight vector. This function is initially set to some prior distribution. \\nOnce the data has been observed, it can be converted to a posterior distribution \\nthrough the use of Bayes' theorem. The posterior distribution can then be used \\nto evaluate the predictions of the trained network for new values of the input\", 'variables, as will be discussed in Section 10.2. \\nThe use of Bayesian learning to infer parameter values from a set of training \\ndata was introduced in Section 2.3 in the context of parametric density esti\\xad\\nmation. There we gave a simple illustration which involved inferring the mean \\nof a Gaussian distribution. We shall see that the more complex problem of in\\xad\\nferring the weights in a neural network proceeds in an analogous manner. For \\nsimplicity of notation, we shall consider networks having a single output vari\\xad\\nable y, although the extension to many output variables is straightforward. Most \\nof the discussion in this chapter will concern function approximation problems, \\nfor the case of noise-free input data and noisy target data. The application \\nof Bayesian methods to classification problems will be discussed briefly in Sec\\xad\\ntion 10.3. Bayesian inference for noise-free data has been studied by Sibisi (1991),', \"and the problem of interpolating data with noise on both dependent and inde\\xad\\npendent variables has been discussed in the context of straight-line fitting by \\nGull (1988a). \\n10.1.1 Distribution of weights \\nWe begin by considering the problem of training a network in which the archi\\xad\\ntecture (number of layers, number of hidden units, choice of activation functions \\netc.) is given. In the conventional maximum likelihood approach, a single 'best' \\nset of weight values is determined by minimization of a suitable error function. \\nIn the Bayesian framework, however, we consider a probability distribution over \\nweight values. In the absence of any data, this is described by a prior distribution \\nwhich we shall denote by p(w), and whose form we shall discuss shortly. Here \\nw = (u>i,... ,w\\\\y) denotes the vector of adaptive weight (and bias) parameters. \\nLet the target data from the training set be denoted by D = (t1,..., tN). Once\", \"we observe the data D we can write down an expression for the posterior prob\\xad\\nability distribution for the weights, which we denote by p(w\\\\D), using Bayes' \\ntheorem \\n*w|J» = ^^^ do-3) \\nwhere the denominator is a normalization factor which can be written \\np(D)= /p(D|w)p(w)dw (10.4) 10.1: Bayesian learning of network weights 389 \\nand which ensures that the left-hand side of (10.3) gives unity when integrated \\nover all weight space. As we shall see shortly, the quantity p(D\\\\w), which rep\\xad\\nresents a model for the noise process on the target data, corresponds to the \\nlikelihood function encountered in previous chapters. \\nSince the data set consists of input as well as target data, the input values \\nshould strictly be included in Bayes' theorem (10.3) which should therefore be \\nwritten in the form \\nwhere X denotes the set of input vectors (x1,..., xN). As we have already noted \\nin earlier chapters, however, feed-forward networks trained by supervised learn\\xad\", \"ing do not in general model the distribution p(x) of the input data. Thus X \\nalways appears as a conditioning variable on the right-hand side of the proba\\xad\\nbilities in (10.5). We shall therefore continue to omit it from now on in order to \\nsimplify the notation. \\nThe picture of learning provided by the Bayesian formalism is as follows. We \\nstart with some prior distribution over the weights given by p(w). Since we gen\\xad\\nerally have little idea at this stage of what the weight values should be, the prior \\nmight express some rather general properties such as smoothness of the net\\xad\\nwork function, but will otherwise leave the weight values fairly unconstrained. \\nThe prior will therefore typically be a rather broad distribution, as indicated \\nschematically in Figure 10.2. Once we have observed the data, this prior dis\\xad\\ntribution can be converted to a posterior distribution using Bayes' theorem in \\nthe form (10.3). This posterior distribution will be more compact, as indicated\", 'in Figure 10.2, expressing the fact that we have learned something about the \\nextent to which different weight values are consistent with the observed data. In \\norder to evaluate the posterior distribution we need to provide expressions for \\nthe prior distribution p(w) and for the likelihood function p(D\\\\w). \\n10.1.2 Gaussian prior \\nWe first consider the prior probability distribution for the weights. This distri\\xad\\nbution should reflect any prior knowledge we have about the form of network \\nmapping we expect to find. In general, we can write this distribution as an ex\\xad\\nponential of the form \\nP(w) = „ , , exp(-a£iv) (10.6) \\nwhere Zw(a) is a normalization factor given by \\nZw(a)= exp(-aEw)dw (10.7) 390 10: Bayesian Techniques \\np(wlD) \\nFigure 10.2. Schematic plot of the prior distribution of weights p(w) and the \\nposterior distribution p(w|D) which arise in the Bayesian inference of network \\nparameters. The most probable weight vector WMP corresponds to the max\\xad', \"imum of the posterior distribution. In practice the posterior distribution will \\ntypically have a complex structure with many local maxima. \\nwhich ensures that Jp(w) dw = 1. The role of the parameter a will be considered \\nshortly. \\nThe discussion of bias and variance in Section 9.1 indicates that a smooth \\nnetwork function will typically have better generalization than one which is over-\\nfitted to the training data (assuming that the underlying function which we wish \\nto approximate is indeed smooth). This is one of the motivations for regulariza-\\ntion techniques designed to encourage smooth network mappings. Such mappings \\ncan be achieved by favouring small values for the network weights, and this sug\\xad\\ngests the following simple form for Ew \\nEw = dlw w \\n- £».' (10.8) \\n»=1 \\nwhere W is the total number of weights and biases in the network. This corre\\xad\\nsponds to the use of a simple weight-decay regularizer, as we shall see shortly, \\nand gives a prior distribution of the form \\np(w) = 1\", 'Zw{ot) exp (-fllwf). (10.9) \\nThus, when ||w|| is large, Ew is large, and p(w) is small, and so this choice of \\nprior distribution says that we expect the weight values to be small rather than \\nlarge. \\nSince the parameter a itself controls the distribution of other parameters \\n(weights and biases), it is called a hyperparameter.

The', 'network model has a single layer of weights, with a single logistic output given \\nby 392 10: Bayesian Techniques \\np(w) \\nFigure 10.4. Plot of a Gaussian prior shown as a surface over a two-dimensional \\nweight space (wi,u>2)-\\nV(x;w) = 7-T 7 TT • (1(U1) \\nl+exp(— w1x) \\nNote that the weight vector w = (u>i, 11*2) is two-dimensional, and that there is no \\nbias parameter. We shall choose a Gaussian prior distribution for the weights, \\ngiven by (10.9), in which the parameter a is given a fixed value of a = 1. A \\nsurface plot of this prior, as a function of the weight parameters u>\\\\ and W2, is \\nshown in Figure 10.4. \\nFrom Section 6.7.1, we know that the output j/(x; w) of the network in (10.11) \\ncan be interpreted as the probability of membership of class C\\\\, given the input \\nvector x. The probability of membership of class C2 is then (1 — y). If we assume \\nthat the target values are independent and identically distributed, the likelihood', \"function p(D\\\\w) in Bayes' theorem (10.3) will be given by a product of factors, \\none for each data point, where each factor is either y or (1 — y) according to \\nwhether the data point is from class C\\\\ or C2. \\nFirst, suppose we just consider the data points labelled (i) and (ii) in Fig\\xad\\nure 10.3. Then we can calculate the posterior distribution of weights using Bayes' \\ntheorem (10.3). The resulting distribution is plotted in Figure 10.5. We can un\\xad\\nderstand the form of this distribution by first noting that the network function \\nin (10.11) represents a sigmoidal ridge in which the value y = 0.5 (the decision \\nboundary for minimum probability of misclassification) is given by a line passing \\nthrough the origin in Figure 10.3. The two weight parameters W\\\\ and \\\\x>2 control \\nthe orientation of this line and the slope of the sigmoid.

The remaining weight vectors are largely unaffected and so the shape of the \\nposterior distribution in the corresponding region of weight space then reflects \\nthat of the prior distribution in Figure 10.4. \\nIf we now include all four patterns from Figure 10.3, we obtain the posterior \\ndistribution shown in Figure 10.6. As a result of the way patterns (iii) and \\n(iv) are labelled, there is now no decision boundary which classifies all four 394 10: Bayesian Techniques\", \"points perfectly. The most probable solution is one in which the sigmoid has a \\nparticular orientation and slope, and solutions which differ significantly from this \\nhave much lower probability. The posterior distribution of weights is therefore \\nrelatively narrow. \\n10.1.4 Gaussian noise model \\nWe turn now to more general architectures of feed-forward network, and to a \\nconsideration of 'regression' problems. Later we shall return to a discussion of \\nBayesian methods for classification. \\nIn general, we can write the likelihood function in Bayes' theorem (10.3) in \\nthe form \\nP(D\\\\v) = ^~ exp(-pED) (10.12) \\nwhere Ep is an error function, and 0 is another example of a hyperparameter \\nwhich will be discussed shortly. The function ZD{(3) is a normalization factor \\ngiven by \\nZDW) = Jexp(-pED)dD (10.13) \\nwhere / dD = J dt1... dtN represents an integration over the target variables. \\nAs in Section 6.1, we shall assume that the target data is generated from a\", 'smooth function with additive zero-mean Gaussian noise, so that the probability \\nof observing a data value t for a given input vector x would be \\np(t|x,w) a exp (-|{tf(x; w) - t}2) (10.14) \\nwhere j/(x;w) represents a network function governing the mean of the distribu\\xad\\ntion, w represents the corresponding network weight vector, and the parameter \\n0 controls the variance of the noise. Provided the data points are drawn inde\\xad\\npendently from this distribution, we have \\nN \\np(D\\\\w)=l[p(tn\\\\xn,v,) \\nn=l \\n= ^Wexp(-f£{y(xn;w)-<n}2) (1(U5) \\nThe expression (10.13) for the normalization factor Zp(P) is then the product \\nof N independent Gaussian integrals which are easily evaluated (Appendix B) 10.1: Bayesian learning of network weights 395 \\nto give \\n/2TT\\\\N/2 \\nZD(0) = (j) (10.16) \\nFor the moment we shall treat /? as a fixed, known constant. We shall return \\nto the problem of determining this parameter as part of the learning process in \\nSections 10.4 and 10.5.', \"10.1.5 Posterior distribution of weight values \\nOnce we have chosen a prior distribution, and an expression for the likelihood \\nfunction, we can use Bayes' theorem in the form (10.3) and (10.4) to find the \\nposterior distribution of the weights. Using our general expressions (10.6) and \\n(10.12) we obtain the posterior distribution in the form \\np(w|D) = i- exp(-0ED - aEw) = ±- exp(-5(w)) (10.17) \\nAS &S \\nwhere \\nand S(w) = 0ED + aEw (10.18) \\nZs{a, 0)= I exp(-/3£D - aEw) dw. (10.19) \\nConsider first the problem of finding the weight vector WMP corresponding to \\nthe maximum of the posterior distribution. This can be found by minimizing the \\nnegative logarithm of (10.17) with respect to the weights. Since the normalizing \\nfactor Zs in (10.17) is independent of the weights, we see that this is equivalent \\nto minimizing S'(w) given by (10.18). For the particular prior distribution given \\nby (10.9) and noise model given by (10.15), this can be written in the form \\nft N W\", 'We see that, apart from an overall multiplicative factor, this is precisely the \\nusual sum-of-squares error function with a weight-decay regularization term, as \\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1. Note that, if we are only interested in finding the \\nweight vector which minimizes this error function, the effective value of the \\nregularization parameter (the coefficient of the regularizing term) depends only \\non the ratio a//3, since an overall multiplicative factor is unimportant. \\nThe most probable value for the weight vector, denoted by WMP, corresponds 396 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nto the maximum of the posterior probability, or equivalently to the minimum of \\nthe right-hand side in (10.20). If we consider a succession of training sets with \\nincreasing numbers N of patterns then we see that the first term in (10.20) \\ngrows with iV while the second term does not. If a and j3 are fixed, then as TV \\nincreases, the first term becomes more and more dominant, until eventually the', 'second term becomes insignificant. The maximum likelihood solution is then a \\nvery good approximation to the most probable solution WMP- Conversely, for \\nvery small data sets the prior term plays an important role in determining the \\nlocation of the most probable solution. \\n10.1.6 Consistent priors \\nWe have seen that a quadratic prior, consisting of a sum over all weights (and \\nbiases) in the network, corresponds to a simple weight-decay regularizer. In Sec\\xad\\ntion 9.2.2, we showed that this regularizer has an intrinsic inconsistency with \\nthe known scaling properties of network mappings. This led to a consideration \\nof weight-decay regularizers in which there is a different regularization coefficient \\nfor weights in different layers, and in which biases are excluded. For a two-layer \\nnetwork, this suggests a prior of the form \\np(w) oc exp (-^ £ w* - ^ £ A (10.21) \\nwhere Wi denotes the set of weights in the first layer, )% denotes the set of', 'weights in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations. Note \\nthat priors of this form are improper (they cannot be normalized) since the bias \\nparameters are unconstrained. The use of improper priors can lead to difficul\\xad\\nties in selecting regularization coefficients and in model comparison within the \\nBayesian framework, since the corresponding evidence is zero. It is therefore \\ncommon to include separate priors for the biases. \\nMore generally, we can consider priors in which the weights are divided into \\nany number of groups W/t so that \\np(w) <x exp f-i £>A||w||i J (10.22) \\nwhere \\nIMI2 = £ w2. (10.23) \\nw€Wk \\nFor simplicity of exposition, we shall continue to use a Gaussian prior of \\nthe form (10.9). The extension of the Bayesian analysis to account for the more \\ngeneral prior (10.22) is straightforward, and the reader is led through the relevant 10.1: Bayesian learning of network weights 397 \\nanalysis in Exercises 10.5 to 10.8.', '10.1.7 Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution \\nGiven our particular choices for the noise model and the prior, the expressions \\n(10.17) and (10.20) defining the posterior distribution are exact (although in gen\\xad\\neral the normalization coefficient Zs{a,fi) cannot be evaluated analytically). In \\npractice we wish to evaluate the probability distribution of network predictions, \\nas well as the evidences for the hyperparameters and for the model. These re\\xad\\nquire integrations over weight space, and in order to make these integrals analyt\\xad\\nically tractable, we need to introduce some simplifying approximations. MacKay \\n(1992d) uses a Gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution. This is ob\\xad\\ntained by considering the Taylor expansion of S(w) around its minimum value \\nand retaining terms up to second order so that \\n5(w) = S(wMp) + g(w - wMP)T A (w - wMp) (10.24) \\nwhere the linear term has vanished since we are expanding around a minimum', 'of S(w). Here A is the Hessian matrix of the total (regularized) error function, \\nwith elements given by \\nA = VV5MP \\n= ,3VV£$P + al. (10.25) \\nA variety of exact and approximate methods for evaluating the Hessian of the \\nerror function ED were discussed in Section 4.10. \\nThe expansion (10.24) leads to a posterior distribution which is now a Gaus\\xad\\nsian function of the weights, given by \\np(w|D) = ^ exp (-S(WMP) - \\\\ AwT A Aw) (10.26) \\nwhere Aw = w — WMP, and Z*s is the normalization constant appropriate to \\nthe Gaussian approximation. Some partial justification for this approximation \\ncomes from the result of Walker (1969), which says that, under very general cir\\xad\\ncumstances, a posterior distribution will tend to a Gaussian in the limit where \\nthe number of data points goes to infinity. For very large data sets we might \\nthen expect the Gaussian approximation to be a good one. However, the pri\\xad\\nmary motivation for the Gaussian approximation is that it allows a great deal', \"of progress to be made analytically. Later we shall discuss techniques based on \\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo integration which avoid this approximation. \\nUsing the results given in Appendix B, it is now straightforward to evaluate \\nthe normalization factor Z*s for this Gaussian approximation, in terms of the \\ndeterminant of the matrix A, to give 398 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nZ*s(a,/3) = e-5(WMp)(27r)w/2|Ar1/2. (10.27) \\nFor a general non-linear network mapping function y(x; w), e.g. a multi-layer \\nperceptron, there may be numerous local minima of the error function, some of \\nwhich may be associated with symmetries in the network. For instance, if we con\\xad\\nsider a multi-layer perceptron with two layers of weights, M hidden units, and \\nanti-symmetric hidden unit activation functions (e.g. the 'tanh' function), then \\neach distinct local minimum belongs to a family of 2MM\\\\ equivalent minima, as \\ndiscussed in Section 4.4. The weight vectors corresponding to these different min\\xad\", \"ima are related by transformations which interchange the hidden units and reflect \\nthe signs of the weights associated with individual hidden units. There may be \\nseveral families of such minima, where the different families are non-equivalent \\nand are not related by symmetry transformations. The single-Gaussian approx\\xad\\nimation given by (10.26) clearly does not take multiple minima into account. \\nOne approach is to approximate the posterior distribution by a sum of Gaus-\\nsians, once centred on each of the minima (MacKay, 1992d), and we shall see \\nhow to make use of this approximation in Section 10.7. \\n10.2 Distribution of network outputs \\nAs we have seen, in the Bayesian formalism a 'trained' network is described in \\nterms of the posterior probability distribution of weight values. If we present a \\nnew input vector to such a network, then the distribution of weights gives rise \\nto a distribution of network outputs. In addition, there will be a contribution to\", 'the output distribution arising from the assumed Gaussian noise on the output \\nvariables. Here we shall calculate the distribution of output values, using the \\nsingle-Gaussian approximation introduced above. \\nUsing the rules of probability, we can write the distribution of outputs, for a \\ngiven input vector x, in the form \\np(t\\\\x,D) = fp(t\\\\x,w)p(w\\\\D)dw (10.28) \\nwhere p{w\\\\D) is the posterior distribution of weights. The distribution p{t\\\\x, w) \\nis simply the model for the distribution of noise on the target data, for a fixed \\nvalue of the weight vector, and is given by (10.14). \\nIn order to evaluate this distribution we shall make use of the Gaussian \\napproximation (10.26) for the posterior distribution of weights, together with \\nthe expression (10.14) for the distribution of network outputs. This gives \\np(t\\\\x,D) <x /exp (~{t - y(x;w)}A exp (-^AwTAAwj dw (10.29) \\nwhere we have dropped any constant factors (i.e. factors independent of t). In', 'addition, we shall assume that the width of the posterior distribution (determined 10.2: Distribution of network outputs 399 \\nby the Hessian matrix A) is sufficiently narrow that we may approximate the \\nnetwork function j/(x; w) by its linear expansion around wjjp \\ny(x; w) = y(x; wMP) + gTAw (10.30) \\nwhere \\n8 = V-2/lwMP • (10-31) \\nThis allows us to write (10.29) in the form \\np(t\\\\x,D) ex /exp (-|{t - J/MP - gTAw}2 - ^AwTAAwJ dw (10.32) \\nwhere J/MP = 2/(X;WMP)- The integral in (10.32) is easily evaluated (Exer\\xad\\ncises 10.1 and 10.2) to give a Gaussian distribution of the form \\n^•^(•^^-^H^) (ia33) \\nwhere we have restored the normalization factor explicitly. This distribution has \\na mean given by J/MP> and a variance given by \\n(^i+gTA^g.

When the noise \\namplitude is large, so that 0 is small, the noise term dominates, as indicated in \\nFigure 10.7. For a small noise amplitude (large value of 0) the variance of the \\noutput distribution is dominated by the contribution from the variance of the \\nposterior distribution of weights, as shown in Figure 10.8. \\nWe see that the Bayesian formalism allows us to calculate error bars on \\nthe network outputs, instead of just providing a single 'best guess' output. In \\na practical implementation, we first find the most probable weights WMP by \\nminimizing the regularized error function S(w).

Two approaches to the treatment \\nof hyperparameters have been discussed in the literature. One of these performs \\nthe integrals over a and /? analytically, and will be discussed in Section 10.5. \\nAn alternative approach, known as the evidence approximation, has been dis\\xad\\ncussed by MacKay (1992a, 1992d) and will be considered first. This framework\", 'is based on techniques developed by Gull (1988b, 1989) and Skilling (1991). It is \\ncomputationally equivalent to the type II maximum likelihood (ML-II) method \\nof conventional statistics (Berger, 1985). \\nLet us suppose that the posterior probability distribution p(a,P\\\\D) for the \\nhyperparameters in (10.59) is sharply peaked around their most probable values 408 10: Bayesian Techniques \\naMP and /?MP- Then (10.59) can be written \\np(w|£>) ~ p(w\\\\aUPtpMP,D) jjp(a,p\\\\D) dad/3 (10.60) \\n= p(w\\\\aMp,pMP,D). (10.61) \\nThis says that we should find the values of the hyperparameters which maximize \\nthe posterior probability, and then perform the remaining calculations with the \\nhyperparameters set to these values. We shall discuss the validity of this approx\\xad\\nimation later, when we consider the alternative approach of exact integration. \\nIn order to find QMP and Pup, we need to evaluated the posterior distribution \\nof a and 0. This is given by', 'which requires a choice for the prior p(a, 0). Since this represents a prior over the \\nhyperparameters, it is sometimes called a hyperprior. The distribution of weight \\nparameters, for example, is governed by a parameter a which itself is described \\nby a distribution. Schemes such as this are called hierarchical models and can be \\nextended to any number of levels. If we have no idea of what would be suitable \\nvalues for a and 0, then we should choose a prior which in some sense gives \\nequal weight to all possible values. Such priors are called non:informative and are \\ndiscussed at length in Berger (1985). They often have the characteristic that they \\ncannot be normalized since the integral of the prior diverges. Priors for which \\nthis is the case are called improper. An example would be a prior for a parameter \\na which is taken to be uniform over an infinite interval (0, oo). In fact, a and 0 \\nare examples of scale parameters since they determine the scale of ||w||2 and of', 'the noise respectively. Non-informative priors for scale parameters are generally \\nchosen to be uniform on a logarithmic scale as discussed in Exercise 10.13. \\nFor the moment we shall suppose that the hyperprior p{a,3) is chosen to be \\nvery insensitive to the values of a and 0 to reflect the fact that we have little idea \\nof suitable values for these quantities. Later we shall discuss more formally how \\nto choose suitable hyperpriors. Since the denominator in (10.62) is independent \\nof a and 0, we see that the maximum-posterior values for these hyperparameters \\nare found by maximizing the likelihood term p(D\\\\a,0). This term is called the \\nevidence for a and 0. \\nNote that the Bayesian analysis is proceeding in a hierarchical fashion. The \\nfirst level involves the determination of the distribution of weight values. At \\nthe second level we are seeking the distribution of hyperparameter values. The \\nevidence p(D\\\\a,0) at this level of the hierarchy is given by the denominator in', \"Bayes' theorem (10.3) from the previous level. \\nWe can easily express the evidence in terms of quantities which we have 10.4: The evidence framework for a and P 409 \\nevaluated already.

For an error function ED which is exactly a \\nquadratic function of the weights (as is the case for a linear network and a sum-\\nof-squares error function), the Hessian will be constant and this assumption will \\nbe exact. For non-linear network models, the Hessian H will be a function of w.', \"Since the Hessian is evaluated at w^p, and since WMP depends on a, we see that \\nthe result (10.68) actually neglects terms involving d\\\\l/da (MacKay, 1992a). \\nWith this approximation, the maximization of (10.67) with respect to a is \\nthen straightforward with the result that, at the maximum, \\nw \\n2aE%p = W - Y —— = 7 (10.69) •ft —^ A • -4- rv \\ni=1A' + Q \\nwhere the quantity 7 is defined by \\nThis result can be given a simple and elegant interpretation (Gull, 1989).

If we assume for the moment that the eigenvalues \\nA; are positive then the quantity -yt = Aj/(Aj + a) is a quantity which lies in the \\nrange 0 to 1. This can be interpreted geometrically if we imagine rotating the axes \\nof weight space to align them with the eigenvectors of H as shown schematically\", \"in Figure 10.12.

(See also the discussions of weight-decay regularization and early \\nstopping in Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.4 respectively). Thus 7 measures the effective \\nnumber of weights whose values are controlled by the data rather than by the \\nprior. Such weights are called well-determined parameters.

From (10.18), (10.69) and (10.73) we see \\nthat the total error S'(w), evaluated at WMP, satisfies the relation 2SMP = TV. \\nSo far our analysis has assumed that the posterior distribution is described \\nby a single Gaussian function of the weights. As we have already observed, how\\xad\\never, this is not an adequate description of the posterior distribution in the case \\nof non-linear networks since there are many minima present in the regularized \\nerror function 5(w). The approach adopted by MacKay (1992d) is to note that\", 'we are using a particular set of weights WMP to make predictions, correspond\\xad\\ning to a particular local minimum of S(w). Thus, we can set the values of a \\nand /3 appropriately for this particular solution, noting that different minima \\nmay require different values for these hyperparameters.

By considering a Gaussian approximation to the posterior dis\\xad\\ntribution in the neighbourhood of this minimum, we then arrive at the formalism \\nfor determining a and /3 derived above. Later we shall discuss how to deal with \\nmultiple minima. \\nIn a practical implementation of this approach, we need to find the optimum \\na and /? as well as the optimum weight vector WMP- A simple approach to this \\nproblem is to use a standard iterative training algorithm, of the kind described', 'in Chapter 7, to find WMP, while periodically re-estimating the values of a and \\nP using \\nanew = i/2Ew (10.74) \\n^new = (N_ 7)/2££) (10.75) \\nwhich follow from (10.69) and (10.73).

In practice, one technique which we have considered above, which MacKay \\n(1994b) refers to as the 'MAP' approach (for maximum posterior) is to perform \\nthis integration analytically. An alternative approach is to use the evidence ap\\xad\\nproximation, which involves finding the values of the hyperparameters which \\nmaximize the evidence, and then performing subsequent analysis with the hy\\xad\\nperparameters fixed to these values. Since the exact integration is so easily per\\xad\\nformed, it might appear that this should be the preferred approach (Wolpert, \\n1993). As well as being exact, it has the advantage of saving the significant com\\xad\\nputational effort of the evidence approximation, which has to be repeated afresh \\nfor each new data set. \\nHowever, MacKay (1994b) has argued that in practice the evidence approx\\xad\\nimation will often be expected to give superior results. The reason that this\", 'could in principle be the case, even though formally we should integrate over \\nthe hyperparameters, is that in practice with exact integration the remainder \\nof the Bayesian analysis cannot be carried through without introducing further \\napproximations, and these subsequent approximations can lead to much greater-\\ninaccuracies than the evidence approach. \\nConsider the regularization parameter a.

In order to make use of this expression in practice, \\nhowever, it is necessary to make some approximations. Typically, this would \\ninvolve finding the maximum posterior weight vector WMP by a standard non\\xad\\nlinear optimization algorithm, and then fitting a Gaussian approximation around \\nthis value (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). Clearly the MAP method is capable of \\nfinding a true value for WMP, and so the value found within the evidence ap\\xad\\nproximation must be in error (to the extent that the two approaches differ). \\nHowever, MacKay (1994b) has argued that the Gaussian approximation found \\nby the evidence approach finds a better representation for most of the volume \\nof the posterior probability distribution than does the MAP approach. Since 418 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nthe error bars around the most probable a and 0 determined from the evidence \\napproximation are given by (10.84) and (10.81), we expect the evidence approx\\xad', 'imation to be valid when )» 1 and N — 7 3> 1. A more thorough discussion \\nof the conditions for the validity of the evidence approximation are given in \\nMacKay (1994b). \\n10.6 Bayesian model comparison \\nSo far we have considered Bayesian methods for finding the most probable out\\xad\\nputs from a neural network, for estimating error bars on these outputs, and \\nfor setting the values of regularization coefficients and noise parameters. Our \\nfinal application for Bayesian methods is to the comparison of different models. \\nAs we have already indicated, the Bayesian formalism automatically penalizes \\nhighly complex models and so is able to pick out an optimal model without re\\xad\\nsorting to the use of independent data as in methods such as cross-validation \\n(Section 9.8.1). \\nSuppose we have a set of models Hi, which might for example include multi\\xad\\nlayer perceptron networks with various numbers of hidden units, radial basis', \"function networks and linear models. From Bayes' theorem we can write down \\nthe posterior probabilities of the various models Hi, once we have observed the \\ntraining data set D, in the form \\nP(nm , rfWTO (10.96) \\np{D) \\nwhere P(Hi) is the prior probability assigned to model Hi, and the quantity \\np(D\\\\Hi), referred to as the evidence for Hi (MacKay, 1992a). This evidence is \\nprecisely the denominator in (10.62) in which we have made the conditional \\ndependence on the model Hi explicit. If we have no reason to assign different \\npriors to different models, then we can compare the relative probabilities of \\ndifferent models on the basis of their evidence. Again, we note the hierarchical \\nnature of this Bayesian framework, with the evidence at this level being given \\nby the denominator of Bayes' theorem at the previous level. \\nWe can provide a simple interpretation of the evidence, and the way it penal\\xad\\nizes complex models, as follows (MacKay, 1992a). First, we write the evidence\", 'in the form \\np(D\\\\Hi) = /p(£\\'|w,?t:i)p(w|Wi)rfw. (10.97) \\nNow consider a single weight parameter w.

When the data arrives this col\\xad\\nlapses to a posterior distribution p(w\\\\D, H) with a width AtWposterior- The ratio \\nAu>pOBterior/Attiprior represents the Occam factor which penalizes the model for \\nhaving the particular posterior distribution of weights. \\nas indicated in Figure 10.15. If we take the prior to be uniform over some large', 'interval Atyprjor then (10.98) becomes \\np(D\\\\Hi) * PPIUMP.W,) (A^toiOT) . (10.99) \\nThe first term on the right-hand side is the likelihood evaluated for the most \\nprobable weight values, while the second term, which is referred to as an Occam \\nfactor and which has value < 1, penalizes the network for having this particular \\nposterior distribution of weights. For a model with many parameters, each will \\ngenerate a similar Occam factor and so the evidence will be correspondingly \\nreduced. Similarly a model in which the parameters have to be finely tuned will \\nalso be penalized with a small Occam factor. A model which has a large best-fit \\nlikelihood will receive a large contribution to the evidence. However, if the model \\nis also very complex then the Occam factor will be very small. The model with \\nthe largest evidence will be determined by the balance between needing large \\nlikelihood (to fit the data well) and needing a relatively large Occam factor (so', 'that the model is not too complex). \\nWe can evaluate the evidence more precisely as follows. We first write \\np{D\\\\Hi)= 11p{D\\\\a,p,Hi)p{a,p\\\\Hi)dadf3. (10.100) \\nThe quantity p(D\\\\a, (3, Hi) is just the evidence for a and /? which we considered \\nearlier (with the dependence on the model again made explicit). Integration over 420 10: Bayesian Techniques \\na and (i is easily performed using the Gaussian approximation for the distribution \\np(D\\\\a,p,Hi) introduced in Section 10.4, in which the variance parameters are \\ngiven by (10.81) and (10.84). Consider the integration over f3. Prom (10.78) this \\ncan be written in the form \\nmm \\\\ f ( (M-ln/W P(D\\\\PMP) J exp I —2 \\niw^^w* (10101) \\nwhere we have taken the prior distribution for In /3 to be constant over some large \\nregion In fl which encompasses /3MP as well as most of the probability mass of \\nthe Gaussian distribution. A similar argument applies to the parameter a. Thus \\nwe have \\np(D\\\\Hi)^p(D\\\\aUP,pUP,Hi)2n^li^£. (10.102)', 'We can obtain an expression for lnp(D|aMP,/?MP> \"Hi) by using (10.67) and set\\xad\\nting a = QMP and (3 = /?MP-\\nThe result (10.67) was obtained by integrating over the posterior distribution \\np(w\\\\D,Hi) represented by a single Gaussian. As we have already remarked, \\nfor any given configuration of the weights (corresponding to the mean of the \\nGaussian) there are many equivalent weight vectors related by symmetries of \\nthe network. Here we consider a two-layer network having M hidden units, so \\nthat the degree of redundancy is given by 2MM! as discussed in Section 4.4. The \\nOccam factor which we are trying to estimate depends on the ratio of the volume \\nof the posterior distribution in weight space to the volume of the prior. Since our \\nexpression for the prior (a Gaussian centred on the origin) already takes account \\nof the many equivalent configurations, we must ensure that our expression for \\nthe posterior also takes these into account. Thus, we must include an extra factor', \"of 2MM\\\\ in (10.102). Note that this implicitly assumes that there is negligible \\noverlap between the Gaussian functions centred on each such minimum. We shall \\ndiscuss shortly what to do about the presence of other minima which cannot be \\nrelated to the current minimum by symmetry transformations. \\nRather than evaluate the evidence (10.102) it is more convenient to consider \\nits logarithm. Expressions for o\\\\np and <Jina are given by (10.81) and (10.84) \\nrespectively.

One of the reasons for this is that the Hessian is given by the product\", 'of the eigenvalues and so is very sensitive to such errors. This was not the case \\nfor the evaluation of 7 used in the optimization of a and P since 7 depends \\non the sum of the eigenvalues and so is less sensitive to errors in the small \\neigenvalues. Furthermore, the determinant of the Hessian, which measures the \\nvolume of the posterior distribution, will be dominated by the small eigenvalues \\nsince these correspond to directions in which the distribution is relatively broad. \\nOne approach is to take all eigenvalues which are below some (arbitrary) cut-off \\ne and replace them by the value e. A check should then be made to determine if \\nthe resulting model comparisons are sensitive to the value of this cut-off. Clearly \\nsuch an approach is far from satisfactory, and serves to highlight the difficulty of \\ndetermining the model evidence within the Gaussian approximation framework. \\nSince the Bayesian approach to model comparison incorporates a mechanism', 'for penalizing over-complex models, we might expect that the model with the \\nlargest evidence would give the best results on unseen data, in other words that \\nit would have the best generalization properties. MacKay (1992d) and Thodberg \\n(1993) both report observing empirical (anti) correlation between model evidence \\nand generalization error. However, this correlation is far from perfect. Although \\nwe expect some correlation between a model having high evidence and the model \\ngeneralizing well, the evidence is not measuring the same thing as generalization \\nperformance. In particular, we can identify several distinctions between these \\nquantities: \\n1. The test error is measured on a finite data set and so is a noisy quantity. \\n2. The evidence provides a quantitative measure of the relative probabilities \\nof different models. Although one particular model may have the highest \\nprobability, there may be other models for which the probability is still', 'significant. Thus the model with the highest evidence will not necessarily \\ngive the best performance. We shall return to this point shortly when we \\ndiscuss committees of networks. \\n3. If we had two different models which happened to give rise to the same \\nmost-probable interpolant, then they would necessarily have the same gen\\xad\\neralization performance, but the more complex model would have a larger \\nOccam factor and hence would have a smaller evidence. Thus, for two mod\\xad\\nels which make the same predictions, the Bayesian approach favours the \\nsimpler model. 422 10: Bayesian Techniques \\n4. The generalization error, in the form considered above, is measured using \\na network with weights set to the maximum of the posterior distribution. \\nThe evidence, however, takes account of the complete posterior distribution \\naround the most probable value. (As we noted in Section 10.3, however, for \\nthe case of a Gaussian posterior distribution, and with a local linearization', \"of the network function, the integration over the posterior has no effect on \\nthe network predictions.) \\n5. The Bayesian analysis implicitly assumes that the set of models under \\nconsideration contains the 'truth' as a particular case. If all of the models \\nare poorly matched to the problem then the relative evidences of different \\nmodels may be misleading. MacKay (1992d) argues that a poor correlation \\nbetween evidence and generalization error can be used to infer the presence \\nof limitations in the models. \\nAn additional reason why the correlation between evidence and test error may \\nbe poor is that there will be inaccuracies in evaluating the evidence. These arise \\nfrom the use of a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution, and \\nare particularly important if the Hessian matrix has one or more very small \\neigenvalues, as discussed above. \\nFurther insight into the issue of model complexity in the Bayesian frame\\xad\", 'work has been provided by Neal (1994) who has argued that, provided the com\\xad\\nplete Bayesian analysis is performed without approximation, there is no need \\nto limit the complexity of a model even when there is relatively little training \\ndata available. Many real-world applications of neural networks (for example \\nthe recognition of handwritten characters) involve a multitude of complications \\nand we do not expect them to be accurately solved by a simple network having \\na few hidden units. Neal (1994) was therefore led to consider the behaviour of \\npriors over weights in the limit as the number of hidden units tends to infinity. \\nHe showed that, provided the parameters governing the priors are scaled appro\\xad\\npriately with the number of units, the resulting prior distributions over network \\nfunctions are well behaved in this limit. Such priors could in principle permit the \\nuse of very large networks. In practice, we may wish to limit the complexity in', \"order to ensure that Gaussian assumptions are valid, or that Monte Carlo tech\\xad\\nniques (discussed in Section 10.9) can produce acceptable answers in reasonable \\ncomputational time. \\n10.7 Committees of networks \\nIn Section 9.6 we discussed techniques for combining several network 'modules' \\ntogether in order to obtain improved performance. Here we shall see how such \\ncommittees of networks arise naturally in the Bayesian framework. When we \\nevaluated the evidence in (10.103) we took account of the multiple solutions due \\nto symmetries in the network. We did not, however, allow for the presence of \\nmultiple, non-equivalent minima. If we train our network several times starting \\nfrom different random initial weight configurations then we will typically discover \\nseveral such solutions. We can then model the posterior distribution using a set 10.7: Committees of networks 423 \\nof Gaussians, one centred on each local minimum, in which we assume that there\", 'is negligible overlap between the Gaussians. \\nConsider the predictions made by such a posterior distribution when the \\nnetwork is presented with a new input vector. The posterior distribution of the \\nweights can be represented as \\np(w|D) = ^p(m1,w|D) \\ni \\n= ^p(w\\\\mhD)P(mi\\\\D) (10.104) \\ni \\nwhere m» denotes one of the non-equivalent minima and all of its symmetric \\nequivalents. This distribution is used to determine other quantities by integration \\nover the whole of weight space. For instance, the mean output predicted by the \\ncommittee is given by \\ny= y(x;w)p(w\\\\D)dw \\n.. =y\\\\P{mt\\\\D) f i/(x;w)p(w|mJ)I>)dw \\ni Jr< \\n= Y,p(mi\\\\D)yi (10105) \\nwhere Fj denotes the region of weight space surrounding the ith local minimum, \\nand yi is the corresponding network prediction averaged over this region. Here we \\nhave assumed that there is negligible overlap between the distributions centred \\non each minimum. From (10.105) we see that the predicted output is just a linear', 'combination of the predictions made by each of the networks corresponding to \\ndistinct local minima, weighted by the posterior probability of that solution. \\nNote that, strictly speaking, in a practical implementation the weighting for \\neach minimum should be adjusted according to the probability of that minimum \\nbeing found by the particular parameter optimization algorithm being used, \\nwith minima which are more likely to be discovered receiving less weight. For \\nlarge problems such an approach is infeasible, however, since each minimum will \\ntypically only be seen once so that determination of the probabilities of finding \\nthe minima will not be possible. \\nWe can extend this result further by considering different models Hi, such as \\nnetworks with different numbers of hidden units or different kinds of models. In \\nthe same way that variables such as hyperparameters are integrated out of the \\nmodel, so if our model space consists of several distinct models, then Bayesian', 'inference requires that, instead of just picking the most probable model, we 424 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nshould sum over all models. The distribution of some quantity Q, given a data \\nset D, can be written \\nP(Q\\\\D) = Y/p(Q,Hi\\\\D) \\ni \\n= $>(Q|A««)p(W«|0) (10.106) \\ni \\nwhich again is a linear combination of the predictions made by each model sep\\xad\\narately, where the weighting coefficients are given by the posterior probabilities \\nof the models. We can compute the weighting coefficients by evaluating the \\nevidences, multiplying by the model priors, and then normalizing so that the \\ncoefficients sum to 1. \\nCommittees bring two advantages. First they can lead to improved general\\xad\\nization, as was noted in Section 9.6. This is to be expected since the extension \\nfrom a single Gaussian to a Gaussian mixture provides a more accurate model \\nfor the posterior distribution of weights. The second benefit of considering a \\ncommittee is that the spread of predictions between members of the committee', 'makes a contribution to the estimated error bars on our predictions in addition \\nto those identified already, leading to more accurate estimation of error bars. \\nIn practice, the direct application of such procedures generally leads to poor \\nresults since the integral over the Gaussian approximation to the posterior gives \\nonly a poor estimation of the evidence (Thodberg, 1993). A more pragmatic \\napproach is to use the evidence simply as a rough indicator, and to select a \\ncommittee of networks whose members have reasonably high evidence, and then \\nform linear, or non-linear, combinations of the outputs of the committee mem\\xad\\nbers using techniques discussed in Section 9.6. Indeed, the method of stacked \\ngeneralization (Section 9.8.2) can be viewed here as a cross-validatory approach \\nto estimating the posterior probabilities of the members of the committee. \\n10.8 Practical implementation of Bayesian techniques', 'Since we have covered a lot of ground in our discussion of Bayesian methods, \\nwe summarize here the main steps needed to implement these techniques for \\npractical applications. We restrict attention to the evidence framework with the \\nuse of Gaussian approximations. \\n1. Choose initial values for the hyperparameters a and /3. Initialize the weights \\nin the network using values drawn from the prior distribution. \\n2. Train the network using a standard non-linear optimization algorithm \\n(Chapter 7) to minimize the total error function S(w). \\n3. Every few cycles of the algorithm, re-estimate values for a and /3 using \\n(10.74) and (10.75), with 7 calculated using (10.70). This requires evalua\\xad\\ntion of the Hessian matrix (Section 4.10) and evaluation of its eigenvalue \\nspectrum. 10.9: Monte Carlo methods 425 \\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for different random initial choices for the network weights \\nin order to find different local minima.

Repeat steps 1-4 for a selection of different network models, and compare \\ntheir evidences using (10.103). Eigenvalues which are smaller than a cutoff \\nvalue are omitted from the sum in evaluating the log determinant of the \\nHessian. If a committee of networks is to be used it is probably best to \\nchoose a selection of the better networks on the basis of their evidences, \\nbut then to use the techniques of Section 9.6 to compute suitable weighting \\ncoefficients. \\nExamples of the practical application of Bayesian techniques are given in Thod-\\nberg (1993) and MacKay (1995b). \\n10.9 Monte Carlo methods \\nIn the conventional (maximum likelihood) approach to network training, the bulk \\nof the computational effort is concerned with optimization, in order to find the \\nminimum of an error function. By contrast, in the Bayesian approach, the cen\\xad', 'tral operations require integration over multi-dimensional spaces. For example, \\nthe evaluation of the distribution of network outputs involves an integral over \\nweight space given by (10.28). Similarly, the evaluation of the evidence for the \\nhyperparameters also involves an integral over weight space given by (10.64). So \\nfar in this chapter, we have concentrated on the use of a Gaussian approximation \\nfor the posterior distribution of the weights, which allows these integrals to be \\nperformed analytically. This also allows the problem of integration to be replaced \\nagain with one of optimization (needed to find the mean of the Gaussian dis\\xad\\ntribution). If we wish to avoid the Gaussian approximation then we might seek \\nnumerical techniques for evaluating the corresponding integrals directly. \\nMany standard numerical integration techniques, which can be used success\\xad\\nfully for integrations over a small number of variables, are totally unsuitable for', \"integrals of the kind we are considering, which involve integration over spaces \\nof hundreds or thousands of weight parameters. For instance, if we try to sam\\xad\\nple weight space on some regular grid then, since the number of grid points \\ngrows exponentially with the dimensionality (see the discussion of the 'curse of \\ndimensionality' in Section 1.4), the computational effort would be prohibitive. \\nWe resort instead to various forms of random sampling of points in weight space. \\nSuch methods are called Monte Carlo techniques. \\nThe integrals we wish to evaluate take the form \\n/= J F(w)p(w\\\\D) dw (10.107) \\nwhere p(w\\\\D) represents posterior distribution of the weights, and F(w) is some \\nintegrand. The basic idea is to approximate (10.107) with the finite sum 426 10: Bayesian Techniques \\n1 h \\nU) (10.108) \\nwhere {w,} represents a sample of weight vectors generated from the distribution \\np(w|£>). The key difficulty is that in general it is very difficult to generate a set\", 'of vectors having the required distribution. \\nOne approach would be to consider some simpler distribution g(w) from \\nwhich we can easily generate suitable vectors. We can then write \\nw<>w (10109) \\nwhich makes use of the fact that we can easily evaluate p(w\\\\D), even though we \\ncannot easily generate vectors having this distribution. In fact we cannot even \\nnormalize p(w|D), and so we should modify (10.109) slightly and use \\nEf=i^K)p(wjp)/g(wi) \\n£?=iP(w«|D)Mw4) i^^i=Xil .111, (io.uo) \\nwhere p(wi\\\\D) is the un-normalized distribution. This approach, which is called \\nimportance sampling, does not solve our problem, because for neural networks \\nthe value of p(w\\\\D) is typically very small except in extremely narrow regions \\nof weight space. Thus, for any simple choice of g(w), most of the vectors will fall \\nin regions where p(w\\\\D) is small, and so a prohibitively large sample of vectors \\nwould be required to build up an accurate approximation to the integral.', 'We must therefore face the task of generating a sample of vectors w represen\\xad\\ntative of the distribution p(w\\\\D). To do this effectively, we must search through \\nweight space to find regions where p(w\\\\D) is reasonably large. This can be done \\nby considering a sequence of vectors, where each successive vector depends on \\nthe previous vector as well as having a random component. Such techniques are \\ncalled Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and are reviewed in Neal (1993). The \\nsimplest example is a random walk in which at successive steps we have \\nwnew = wo!d + e (10.111) \\nwhere e is some small random vector, chosen for instance from a spherical Gaus\\xad\\nsian distribution having a small variance parameter. Note that successive vectors \\ngenerated in this way will no longer be independent. As a result of this depen\\xad\\ndence, the number of vectors needed to achieve a given accuracy in approximat- 10.9: Monte Carlo methods 427', \"ing an integral using (10.108) may be much larger than if the vectors had been \\nindependent. \\nAs it stands, such an approach does not yet achieve the desired aim of sam\\xad\\npling preferentially the regions where p(w\\\\D) is large. This can be achieved by \\na modification to the procedure, known as the Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis \\net al, 1953), which was developed to study the statistical mechanics of physical \\nsystems. The idea is to make candidate steps of the form (10.111), but to re\\xad\\nject a proportion of the steps which lead to a reduction in the value of p(w\\\\D). \\nThis must be done with great care, however, in order to ensure that resulting \\nsample of weight vectors represents the required distribution. In the Metropolis \\nalgorithm this is achieved by using the following criterion: \\nifp(wnew|D) >p(woid|£>) accept \\nif p(wnew|-D) < p(w0|d|D) accept with probability , newlri/- ' \\np(vfo\\\\d\\\\IJ) \\nIn terms of an error function E — — Inp, this can be expressed as \\nif Enevf < EoM accept\", 'if -Enew > Sold accept with probability exp {—(Enev! — Sold)} • (10.113) \\nThe candidate steps are generated in a way which satisfies the principle of de\\xad\\ntailed balance. This requires that, if the current vector is wi, the probability of \\ngenerating a candidate vector W2 must be the same as the probability of gener\\xad\\nating wi as the candidate vector if the current vector is W2- The random walk \\nformula (10.111), for example, with e governed by spherical Gaussian distribu\\xad\\ntion, clearly satisfies this property. The Metropolis algorithm has been used with \\ngreat success in many applications. In the case of the Bayesian integrals needed \\nfor neural networks, however, it can still prove to be deficient due to the strong \\ncorrelations in the posterior distribution, as illustrated in Figure 10.16. \\nThis problem can be tackled by taking account of information concerning the \\ngradient of p(w\\\\D) and using this to choose search directions which favour re\\xad', 'gions of high posterior probability. For neural networks, the gradient information \\nis easily obtained using back-propagation. Again, great care must be taken to \\nensure that the gradient information is used in such a way that the distribution \\nof weight vectors which is generated corresponds to the required distribution. \\nA procedure for achieving this, known as hybrid Monte Carlo, was developed \\nby Duane et al. (1987), and was applied to the Bayesian treatment of neural \\nnetworks by Neal (1992, 1994). \\nOne of the potential difficulties which still remains is the tendency for such \\nalgorithms to spend a long time in the neighbourhood of poor local maxima of \\nthe probability (corresponding to local minima of the regularized error function), \\nand so fail to discover good maxima which make a much more significant contri\\xad\\nbution to the integral. A standard technique for improving the situation is called \\ni. 428 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nW, p(Y/\\\\D)', 'Figure 10.16.

The application of simulated annealing to the Monte Carlo \\nalgorithm for the Bayesian treatment of neural networks has been considered by \\nNeal (1992, 1994) although was not found to be essential. \\nBy using the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm it is possible to generate a suitable \\nsample of weight vectors w* for practical applications of neural networks in \\nreasonable computational time.

The estimation of the evidence, however, remains a \\ndifficult problem. Another significant problem with Monte Carlo methods is the 10.10: Minimum description length 429 \\ndifficulty in defining a suitable termination criterion. Despite these drawbacks, \\nMonte Carlo techniques offer a promising approach to Bayesian inference in the \\ncontext of neural networks. \\n10.10 Minimum description length \\nAn alternative framework for discussing model complexity is provided by the \\nminimum description length principle (Rissanen, 1978). Although conceptually \\nvery different, this approach leads to a formalism which is essentially identical to \\nthe Bayesian one. Imagine that a 'sender' wishes to transmit a data set D to a \\n'receiver', as indicated in Figure 10.17, using a message of the shortest possible \\nlength (where the length of the message might be measured by the number of \\nbits, for instance). One approach would be simply to transmit a suitably encoded\", 'form of the data set itself using some fixed coding scheme with the assumption \\nthat the data points are independent. However, if there are systematic aspects to \\nthe data, the details of which are not known to the receiver in advance of seeing \\nthe data, then we would expect to be able to use a shorter message if we first \\ntransmit information specifying some model % which captures those aspects, \\nusing a message of length L(H), and then send a second message specifying how \\nthe actual data set differs from that predicted by the model. We can regard \\nL(H) as a measure of the complexity of the model, since a more complex model \\nwill require more information to describe it. The message needed to send the \\ndiscrepancy information has length denoted by L(D\\\\H), which can be viewed as \\nan error term. We shall suppose that the input data values are known already to \\nthe receiver, since we are not trying to predict the input data, only the output', \"data. Thus the total length of the message which is sent is given by \\ndescription length = L{D\\\\H) + L{H) (10.115) \\nerror complexity \\nWe can see that the goal of choosing the shortest description length leads to \\na natural form of Occam's razor. A very simple model will be a poor predictor \\nof the data, and so the errors will be large and this will lead to a large error \\nterm in (10.115). Allowing for a more complex model can lead to a reduction in \\nthe error contribution, but too complex a model will require a lot of information \\nto specify and hence will lead to a large complexity term in (10.115). Intuitively \\nwe expect the shortest description length to occur when the model H gives an \\naccurate representation of the statistical process which generated the data, and \\nwe also expect that, on average, this model will have the best generalization \\nproperties. \\nIn Section 6.10 we showed that, to transmit information about a quantity x\", 'efficiently, a sender and receiver should agree on a suitable probability distribu\\xad\\ntion p(x).

This allows us to write the description length in (10.115) in \\nthe form \\ndescription length = - lnp(D\\\\H) - lnp(H) = - lnp(H\\\\D) - Inp{D) (10.116) \\nso that the description length is equivalent, up to an additive constant — lnp(£>), \\nto the negative logarithm of the posterior probability of the model given the data \\nset. \\nWe now consider the problem of determining the values for the weights in \\na network model. Suppose that we consider a particular weight vector, which \\nwe can regard as a 'most probable' set of weights. The cost of transmitting the \\nweights and the data given the model can be written as the sum of two terms \\nL(w, D\\\\H) = - lnp(D|w, H) - lnp(w|W) (10.117) \\nwhere the second term on the right-hand side represents the cost of specifying \\nthe weights, and the first term is the cost of specifying the data for given values\", 'of the weights (i.e. the cost of specifying the errors between the true values for \\nthe data and the values predicted by the model with the weights set to the given \\nvalues). In order to transmit this information, the sender and receiver need to \\nagree on specific forms for the distributions. Suppose we model the distribution \\nof the weights as a zero mean Gaussian with variance a\"1 \\np(w|W) = (~)W/2exp {-f HI2} (10.118) \\nwhere W is the total number of weight parameters. Similarly let us suppose that \\nwe model the distribution of errors by a Gaussian with variance /?_1 centred on \\nthe prediction j/(x; w) made by the model 10.10: Minimum description length 431 \\nFigure 10.18. When a continuous variable x is encoded to some finite precision \\nSx under a distribution p{x), the information required to describe the value of \\nthe variable is given by the negative logarithm of the probability mass under \\nthe distribution, shown by the shaded region. \\nP(^K«) = (^) (sr-Hs*-*} (10.119)', 'Then the description length (10.117) can be written in the form \\n^iw)=!i>n-*n)2+fi n=l iwlr +- const. (10.120) \\nwhich we recognize as the standard sum-of-squares error function with a weight-\\ndecay regularizer. \\nAn additional consideration for continuous variables, which we have so far \\nignored, is the precision with which they are encoded. We cannot specify a con\\xad\\ntinuous quantity x exactly since that would require an infinite message length, \\nso instead we specify its value to within some small tolerance Sx. The message \\nlength needed to do this is given by the negative logarithm of the probability \\nmass within this range of uncertainty, as indicated in Figure 10.18. If the tol\\xad\\nerance Sx is sufficiently small, then this probability mass is given to a good \\napproximation by p(x)Sx. \\nFor the data term lnp(Djw, H) the additional contribution from the precision \\nSD of the variables represents an irrelevant constant. For the weights, however,', \"the precision plays an important role, since if the weights are specified to a low \\nprecision they can be transmitted with a shorter message, but the errors on \\nthe data will then typically be larger and hence will need a longer message to \\ntransmit them. Again, there is a trade-off, which leads to an optimal level of \\nprecision for the weights. For the case of Gaussian distributions, the calculations \\ncan be made explicitly (Wallace and Freeman, 1987). The optimal precision for \\nthe weights is related to the posterior uncertainty in the parameters given by 432 10: Bayesian Techniques \\nA-1 where A = — Wp(w\\\\D,H). The value of the description length with the \\nparameters set to their optimal values, and the weight precision set to its optimal \\nvalue, is then equivalent to the Bayesian evidence given by (10.67). \\nSo far we have considered the situation in which a 'most probable' set of \\nweight values is transmitted. As we have seen, however, the Bayesian approach\", \"requires that we consider not just a single set of weights, but a posterior probabil\\xad\\nity distribution of weights. One way to see how this arises within the description-\\nlength framework is through the 'bits back' argument of Hinton and van Camp \\n(1993). Suppose the sender and receiver have already agreed on some prior dis\\xad\\ntribution p(vf\\\\H). The sender uses the data set D to compute the posterior dis\\xad\\ntribution and then picks a weight vector from this distribution, to within some \\nvery fine tolerance <5w, using a string of random bits. This weight vector can be \\ncommunicated to the receiver by encoding with respect to the prior, with a de\\xad\\nscription length of — ln(p(w|W)«5w). Having sent the weight vector, the data can \\nthen be transmitted with description length — ln{p(D\\\\w,'H)6D). Once the data \\nhas been received, the receiver can then run the same training algorithm as used \\nby the sender and hence compute the posterior distribution. The receiver can\", \"then deduce the string of random bits which were used by the sender to pick the \\nweight vector from the posterior distribution. Since these bits could be used to \\ncommunicate some other, quite unrelated, message, they should not be included \\nin the description length cost. Thus, there is a 'refund' in the description length \\ngiven by +ln(p(w\\\\D,H)6vr), which is just the length of the bit string needed \\nto pick the weight vector from the posterior distribution with precision <5w. The \\nnet description length is therefore given by \\n-ln(p(w|W)<5w) - \\\\n(p(D\\\\w,H)6D) + ln(p(w|D,W)<5w) \\n= -]np(D\\\\H)-\\\\n6D (10.121) \\nwhere we have used Bayes' theorem. This is the correct description length for \\nencoding the data, given the model, to precision 6D. \\nIn this chapter we have considered two approaches to determining the poste\\xad\\nrior distribution of the weights. The first is to find the maximum of the posterior \\ndistribution, and then to fit a Gaussian function centred on this maximum. The\", 'second approach is to express the posterior distribution in terms of a sample \\nof representative vectors, generated using Monte Carlo techniques. We end this \\nchapter by discussing briefly a third approach, known as ensemble learning, which \\nagain assumes a Gaussian distribution, but in which the mean and the variance \\nare allowed to evolve during the learning process (Hinton and van Camp, 1993). \\nLearning can be expressed in terms of a minimization of the Kullback-Leibler \\ndistance (Section 2.5.5) between the model distribution and the true posterior. \\nIn general this is not computationally tractable. However, for two-layer networks \\nwith linear output units, and with the assumption that the covariance matrix \\nof the model distribution is diagonal, the required derivatives can be evaluated Exercises 433 \\nto any desired precision. The hope is that the resulting distribution, which need \\nno longer be centred on the most probable weights, might give a better repre\\xad', 'sentation of the posterior distribution. A potentially important limitation of this \\napproach, however, is the neglect of off-diagonal terms in the model distribution. \\nExercises \\n10.1 (**) Consider a Gaussian distribution of the form \\nand show that this distribution has mean i and variance a1 so that \\ntp(t)dt = t (10.123) \\nf (t - typ(t) dt = a2.

We see that the use of the more general prior (10.133) \\nrequires the eigenvectors of the Hessian to be computed, as well as the \\neigenvalues. The use of the standard weight-decay prior (10.9) requires \\nonly the eigenvalues, leading to a saving of computational effort (Press et \\nal, 1992). \\n10.8 (**) By using the results of the previous exercise, together with (10.79) \\nand analogous expressions for the variances ofn , show that the Gaussian \\napproximation for the evidence p(D\\\\{ak},l3) around the most probable \\nvalues has variances given approximately by \\n4-=(W-7)/2 (10.141) 436 10: Bayesian Techniques \\n-T- = 7fc/2- (10.142)', 'Hence show that the contribution to the logarithm of the model evidence \\narising from the distribution of values of ctk and j3 is given by \\nH^H?>»(4)- (10-143) \\n10.9 (*) Show that, for the logistic sigmoid g(a) given by (10.45), the function \\ng(a) — 0.5 is anti-symmetric.

If the density takes the form \\np(x|0) = /(x - 0) (10.145) \\nthen 0 is said to be a location parameter. An example would be the mean \\nvector in a normal distribution. We can obtain a non-informative prior', \"p(0) for the location parameter by the following argument (Berger, 1985). \\nSuppose that instead of observing x we observed x' = x + c where c is \\na constant (this corresponds to a simple shift of the origin of the coordi\\xad\\nnate system). Then the density of this new variable is /(x' — 0') where \\n0' = 0 + c. Since this has the same structure as the original density, it is Exercises 437 \\nnatural to require that the choice of prior be independent of this change in \\ncoordinates.

Since this has the same structure as (10.147) we require \\nthat the prior for s\\\\ which we denote by p'(s') be the same as the prior \\nfor s.

It is based on the technique \\nof rejection sampling (Devroye, 1986; Press et at, 1992) for generating a', 'random sample from a complex distribution. Consider the problem of gen\\xad\\nerating values for a single variable w from a distribution p(w\\\\D). We shall \\nsuppose that evaluating p(w\\\\D) is straightforward, while generating values \\nof w directly from this distribution is not. Consider a function f(w) which \\nsatisfies f(w) > p{w\\\\D) for all w as shown in Figure 10.19, and suppose \\nthat values of w are generated at random with a distribution proportional \\nto f(w). Verify that, if these values are accepted with probability given \\nby the ratio p(w\\\\D)/f(w) then the accepted values will be governed by \\nthe distribution p(w\\\\D). (Hint: one way to do this is to use Figure 10.19 \\nand to show the result geometrically.) We now apply this technique to \\nthe generation of weight vectors from the posterior distribution of network \\nweights. Suppose we choose /(w) = Ap(w) where A is a constant and \\np(w) is the prior weight distribution. Consider a likelihood function given', 'by (10.12) and use Bayes\\' theorem in the form (10.3) to show that the con\\xad\\ndition /(w) > p(w\\\\D) can be satisfied by choosing A\"1 — Zpp(D) where \\np(D) is the denominator in (10.3). Hence show that weight vectors can be \\ngenerated from the posterior distribution simply by selecting them from \\nthe prior and then accepting them with probability given by exp(—/?£?£>). \\nImplement this numerically for a simple regression problem by consider\\xad\\ning a single-input single-output two-layer network with sigmoidal hidden \\nunits and a linear output unit, together with a data set consisting of no \\nmore than ten data points. Generate weight vectors from a Gaussian prior \\ngiven by (10.9) with a fixed suitably-chosen value of a, and select them Exercises 439 \\nwith a likelihood function exp(—PEp) having a fixed value of 0 and a \\nsum-of-squares error ED until around 10 or 20 weight vectors have been \\naccepted. Techniques for generating numbers with a Gaussian distribution', 'are described in Press et al. (1992). Plot the corresponding set of network \\nfunctions on the same graph, together with the original data points. Use \\nthe results of Exercise 10.14 to plot on a separate graph the Monte Carlo \\nestimates of the mean of the predictive distribution, as well as the error \\nbars, as functions of the input variable x. Note that rejection sampling is \\nnot suitable as a practical technique for large-scale problems since the time \\nrequired by this algorithm grows exponentially with the number of data \\npoints. APPENDIX A \\nSYMMETRIC MATRICES \\nIn several chapters we need to consider the properties of real, symmetric matri\\xad\\nces. Examples include Hessian matrices (whose elements are given by the second \\nderivatives of an error function with respect to the network weights) and covari-\\nance matrices for Gaussian distributions. Symmetric matrices have the property \\nthat Aij = Aji, or equivalently AT = A where AT denotes the transpose of A.', \"The inverse of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric. To see this we start \\nfrom the definition of the inverse given by A-1 A = I where I is the unit matrix, \\nand then use the general result that, for any two matrices A and B, we have \\n(AB)T = BTAT. This gives AT(A_1)T = I which, together with the symmetry \\nproperty AT = A, shows that (A_1)T = A-1 as required. \\nEigenvector equation \\nWe begin by considering the eigenvector equation for a symmetric matrix in the \\nform \\nAufc = Afcufc (A.l) \\nwhere A is a W x W matrix, and k = 1,..., W. The eigenvector equations (A.l) \\nrepresent a set of coupled linear algebraic equations for the components Uki of \\nthe eigenvectors, and can be written in matrix notation as \\n(A - D)U = 0 (A.2) \\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix whose elements consist of the eigenvalues Ajt \\nD=( '.. ] (A.3) \\nand U is a matrix whose columns consist of the eigenvectors u^. The necessary \\nand sufficient condition for the set of simultaneous equations represented by\", '(A.2) to have a solution is that the determinant of the matrix of coefficients \\nvanishes, so that \\n|A-D|=0. (A.4) A: Symmetric Matrices 441 \\nSince this is an W^th order equation it has precisely W roots. \\nWe can show that the eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal \\nset, as follows. For any pair of eigenvectors Uj and u^, it follows from (A.l) that \\nujAujt = Afciijiifc (A.5) \\nujAuj = Aj-ujuj. (A.6) \\nSubtracting these two equations, and using the symmetry property of A we find \\n(Afc-AJ)uJuj=0. (A.7) \\nThus, for Ajt ^ Aj, the eigenvectors must be orthogonal. If Ajt = A;, then any \\nlinear combination of the eigenvectors Uj and u^ will also be an eigenvector, and \\nthis can be used to choose orthogonal linear combinations. A total of W orthog\\xad\\nonal eigenvectors can be found, corresponding to the W solutions of (A.4). Note \\nthat, if u* is an eigenvector with eigenvalue A^, then (5\\\\ik is also an eigenvector,', 'for any non-zero /?, and has the same eigenvalue. This property can be used to \\nnormalize the eigenvectors to unit length, so that they become an orthonormal \\nset satisfying \\n\\\\iluj=6kj. (A.8) \\nIf we multiply (A.l) by A-1 we obtain \\nA-^/t = A^ luk (A.9) \\nso we see that A-1 has the same eigenvectors as A but with reciprocal eigenval\\xad\\nues. \\nDiagonalization \\nThe matrix A can be diagonalized using the matrix U. From (A.l) and (A.8) it \\nfollows that \\nUTAU = D (A.10) \\nwhere D is defined by (A.3). From (A.8) it follows that the matrix U is orthog\\xad\\nonal, in other words it satisfies \\nUTU = UUT = I. (A.ll) \\nConsider a vector x which is transformed by the orthogonal matrix U to give \\na new vector 442 A: Symmetric Matrices \\nx = UTx. (A.12) \\nAs a consequence of the orthogonality property (A.ll), the length of the vector \\nis preserved by this transformation: \\n||x||2 = xTUUTx = ||xf. (A.13) \\nSimilarly, the angle between two vectors is also preserved \\nxjx2 = x7UUTx2 = xjx2. (A.14)', \"Thus, the effect of multiplication by UT is equivalent to a rigid rotation of the \\ncoordinate system. \\nGeneral quadratic form \\nThere are several points in the book where we need to consider quadratic func\\xad\\ntions of the form \\nF(x)=xTAx (A. 15) \\nwhere A is an arbitrary matrix. Note that we can, without loss of generality, \\nassume that the matrix A is symmetric, since any anti-symmetric component \\nwould vanish on the right-hand side of (A.15). We can diagonalize this quadratic \\nform by using the orthogonal matrix U, whose columns are the eigenvectors of \\nA, as follows: \\nF(x) = xTAx \\n= xTUUTAUUTx \\n= xTDx \\nw \\n= X>5' (A.16) \\nt=i \\nwhere we have used (A.10), (A.ll) and (A.12). \\nA matrix A is said to be positive definite if vTAv > 0 for any non-zero \\nvector v. It follows from (A.l) and (A.8) that the eigenvalues of a positive-\\ndefinite matrix are all positive, since \\nAfc = u^Atifc > 0 (A.17)\", \"If the matrix A in the quadratic form (A.15) is positive definite, then it follows A: Symmetric Matrices 443 \\nfrom (A. 16) that the surfaces of constant F(x) are hyperellipsoids, with principal \\naxes having lengths proportional to A^' . APPENDIX B \\nGAUSSIAN INTEGRALS \\nOne variable \\nWe begin by evaluating the following Gaussian integral \\n1= f exp(-^xAdx.

In order to evaluate this integral it\", \"is convenient to consider the eigenvector equation for A in the form \\nAufc = \\\\kuk. (B.5) \\nSince A is real and symmetric, we can choose the eigenvectors to form a complete \\northonormal set \\nu£u, = 6U (B.6) \\nas discussed in Appendix A.

(C.l) \\nOne approach would be to solve the constraint equation (C.l) and thus express', 'i2asa function of xi in the form #2 = h(xi). This can then be substituted into \\nf(xi,X\\'i) to give a function of x\\\\ alone of the form f(xi,h(xi)). The maximum \\nwith respect to x\\\\ could then be found by differentiation in the usual way, to \\ngive the stationary value x\"u\", with the corresponding value of a; 2 given by \\nxfin = h(xf\\'m). \\nOne problem with this approach is that it may be difficult to find an analytic \\nsolution of the constraint equation which allows X2 to be expressed as an explicit \\nfunction of X\\\\. Also, this approach treats £1 and x% differently and so spoils the \\nnatural symmetry between these variables. \\nA more elegant, and often simpler, approach is based on the introduction of \\na parameter A called a Lagrange multiplier. We motivate this technique from \\na geometrical perspective. Consider the case of d variables x\\\\,... ,Xd which we \\ncan group into a vector x. The constraint equation g(x) = 0 then represents a', 'surface in x-space as indicated in Figure C.l. At any point P on the constraint \\nsurface, the gradient of the function /(x) is given by the vector V/. To find \\nthe stationary point of /(x) within the surface we can compute the component \\nV||/ of V/ which lies in the surface, and then set V|j/ = 0. Consider the Taylor \\nexpansion of the function g(x) when we move a short distance from the point x \\nin the form \\ng(x + e)=g(x) + eTVg(x). (C.2) \\nIf the point x + e is chosen to lie within the surface then we have g(x + e) = g(x) \\nand hence eTVp(x) = 0. Thus we see that the vector Vg is normal to the surface \\ng(x) = 0. We can then obtain the component Vy/ which lies in the surface by \\nadding to V/ some multiple of the normal vector Vg so that C: Lagrange Multipliers 449 \\nv»/^\\\\s(x)=0 \\n^ \\nFigure C.l. A geometrical picture of the technique of Lagrange multipliers. \\nThe gradient of a function /(x) at a point P is given by a vector V/. We', 'wish to find the component of this vector lying within the constraint surface \\ng(x) — 0. This can be done by subtracting from Vf an appropriate multiple \\nof the vector normal to the constraint surface, given by V<?. \\nV(|/ = V/ + XVg (C.3) \\nwhere A is a Lagrange multiplier. It is convenient to introduce the Lagrangian \\nfunction given by \\ni(x,A) = /(x) + Ag(x). (C.4) \\nWe then see that the vector VL is given by the right-hand side of (C.3) and so \\nthe required stationarity condition is given by setting VL = 0. Furthermore, the \\ncondition 8L/8X = 0 leads to the constraint equation p(x) = 0. \\nThus to find the minimum of a function /(x) subject to the constraint \\ng(x) = 0 we define the Lagrangian function given by (C.4) and we then find the \\nstationary point of L(x, A) with respect both to x and A. For a d-dimensional \\nvector x this gives d + 1 equations which determine both the stationary point \\nx* and the value of A. If we are only interested in x* then we can eliminate A', \"from the stationarity equations without needing to find its value (hence the term \\n'undetermined multiplier'). \\nAs a simple example, suppose we wish to find the stationary point of the \\nfunction /(a^,^) = X1X2 subject to the constraint g(xi,X2) = x\\\\ + X2 — 1 = 0. \\nThe corresponding Lagrangian function is given by \\nL(x, A) = Xix2 + \\\\(x1 + X2 — 1). (C5) \\nThe conditions for (C.5) to be stationary with respect to Xi, x2, and A then give \\nthe following coupled equations: 450 C: Lagrange Multipliers \\n£2 + A = 0 (C.6) \\nxi + X = 0 (G.7) \\nZft-x2-l =0. (G.8) \\nSolution of these equations gives the stationary point as (xi,xi) = (|, |). \\nThis technique can be applied directly to functions of more than two variables. \\nSimilarly it can be applied when there are several constraints simply by using one \\nLagrange multiplier Xk for each of the constraints 5*(x) = 0 and constructing a \\nLagrangian function of the form \\nL(x, {Xk}) = /(x) + £ Xkffk(x). (C.9) \\nk\", 'This Lagrangian is then minimized with respect to x and {A*}. Extensions to \\nconstrained functional derivatives (Appendix D) are similarly straightforward. \\nA more formal discussion of the technique of Lagrange multipliers can be \\nfound in Dixon (1972, pages 88-93). APPENDIX D \\nCALCULUS OF VARIATIONS \\nAt several points in this book we make use of the technique of functional differ\\xad\\nentiation, also known as calculus of variations. Here we give a brief introduction \\nto this topic, using an analogy to conventional differentiation. We can regard a \\nfunction f(x) as a transformation which takes x as input, and which generates \\n/ as output. For this function we can define its derivative df/dx by considering \\nthe change in f(x) when the value of x is changed by a small amount Sx so that \\n6f = -f-6x + 0{6x2). (D.l) \\nax \\nA function of many variables f{%\\\\,..., Xd) can be regarded as a transformation \\nwhich depends on a discrete set of independent variables. For such a function we \\nhave', 'Sf = ^2 ~Sxi + 0(6x2). (D.2) \\nIn the same way, we can consider a functional, written as B[f], which takes \\na function f{x) as input and returns a scalar value E. As an example of a \\nfunctional, consider \\nso that the value of E[f] depends on the particular choice of the function f(x). \\nThe concept of a functional derivative arises when we consider how much E\\\\j] \\nchanges when we make a small change Sf(x) to the function f(x), where 6f(x) \\nis a function of x which has small magnitude everywhere but which is otherwise \\narbitrary. We denote the functional derivative of E\\\\f] with respect to f{x) by \\nSE/Sf{x), and define it by the following relation: \\nSE = E[f + Sf] - E[f) = f ^6f{x)dx + 0(6f2). (D.4) 452 D: Calculus of Variations \\nThis can be seen as a natural extension of (D.2) where now E[f] depends on \\na continuous set of variables, namely the values of / at all points x. As an \\nillustration, we can calculate the derivative of the functional given in (D.3):', \"E\\\\f + Sf] = E[f] + 2J{^-^6f + f6A dx + °W2)' (D5) \\nThis can be expressed in the form (D.4) if we integrate by parts, and assume \\nthat the boundary term vanishes. We then obtain the following result for the \\nfunctional derivative: \\n6f(x) dx2 \\nNote that, from (D.4) we also have the following useful result: \\nW)=6{x-x,) (DJ) \\nwhere 6{x) is the Dirac delta function. This result is easily verified by taking \\nE\\\\f] = f(x) and then substituting (D.7) into (D.4). \\nIf we require that, to lowest order in Sf(x), the functional E[f] be stationary \\nthen from (D.4) we have \\n/ iTSS'/M** • »• P-s) \\nSince this must hold for an arbitrary choice of 6f(x) we can choose 6f(x) = \\n6(x — x') where 6{x) is the Dirac delta function. Hence it follows that \\n6E .0 (D.9) \\n6f(*) \\nso that, requiring the functional to be stationary with respect to arbitrary vari\\xad\\nations in the function is equivalent to requiring that the functional derivative \\nvanish.\", 'If we define a differential operator D = d/dx then (D.3) can be written as \\nB= I{(Df)2+f}dx. (D.10) \\nFollowing the same argument as before we see that the functional derivative \\nbecomes D: Calculus of Variations 453 \\njj^ = 2DDf(x) + 2/(i) (D.ll) \\nwhere D = —d/dx is the adjoint operator to the operator D. Similar forms of ad\\xad\\njoint operator arise in the discussion of radial basis functions and regularization \\nin Section 5.4. APPENDIX E \\nPRINCIPAL COMPONENTS \\nIn Section 8.6, we showed that the optimal linear dimensionality reduction pro\\xad\\ncedure (in the sense of least squares) was determined by minimization of the \\nfollowing function: \\n= l £ u^Eu, (E.l) i=M+l \\nwhere S is the covariance matrix defined by (8.21). We now show that the solu\\xad\\ntion to this problem can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues \\nof S. \\nIt is clear that (E.l) has a non-trivial minimum with respect to the ut only if \\nwe impose some constraint. A suitable constraint is obtained by requiring the u,', 'to be orthonormal, and can be taken into account by the use of a set of Lagrange \\nmultipliers /iy (Appendix C). We therefore minimize the function \\n^ d ^ d d \\n£M = - £ U?SU\\'\"2 E £ /*«(«7,«i-*«)- (E.2) t=M+l i=M+l j=M+l \\nThis is conveniently written in matrix notation in the form \\nEM = ^I> {UTSU} - ^Tr {M(UTU - 1} (E.3) \\nwhere M is a matrix with elements mj, U is a matrix whose columns consist of \\nthe eigenvectors Uj, and I is the unit matrix. If we minimize (E.3) with respect \\nto U we obtain \\n0 = (E + ET)U-U(M + MT). (E.4) \\nBy definition, the matrix £ is symmetric. Also, the matrix M can be taken to be E: Principal Components 455 \\nsymmetric without loss of generality, since the matrix UUT is symmetric as is \\nthe unit matrix I, and hence any anti-symmetric component in M would vanish \\nin (E.3). Thus, we can write (E.4) in the form \\nSU = UM. (E.5) \\nSince, by construction, U has orthonormal columns, it is an orthogonal matrix', 'satisfying UTU = I. Thus we can write (E.5) in the equivalent form \\nUTSU = M. (E.6) \\nClearly one solution of this equation is to choose M to be diagonal so that the \\ncolumns of U are the eigenvectors of £ and the elements of M are its eigenvalues. \\nHowever, this is not the only possible solution. Consider an arbitrary solution of \\n(E.5). The eigenvector equation for M can be written \\nM* = *A (E.7) \\nwhere A is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Since M is symmetric, the eigen\\xad\\nvector matrix <l> can be chosen to have orthonormal columns. Thus * is an \\northogonal matrix satisfying *T* = I. From (E.7) we then have \\nA = *TM#. (E.8) \\nSubstituting (E.6) into (E.8) we obtain \\nA = *TUTSU* \\n= (U#)T£(U*) \\n= UTSU (E.9) \\nwhere we have defined \\nU = U*. (E.10) \\nUsing *&<&T = I we can write \\nU = U*T. (E.ll) \\nThus, an arbitrary solution to (E.6) can be obtained from the particular solution \\nU by application of an orthogonal transformation given by SP. We now note that', 'the value of the criterion EM is invariant under this transformation since 456 E: Principal Components \\nEM = ^Tr {UTEU} \\n= iTr|*UTEU*T| \\n= ^1> |UTEU] (E.12) \\nwhere we have used the fact that the trace is invariant to cyclic permutations \\nof its argument, together with *T* = I. Since all of the possible solutions \\ngive the same value for the residual error EM, we can choose whichever is most \\nconvenient. We therefore choose the solution given by U since, from (E.9), this \\nhas columns which are the eigenvectors of E. REFERENCES \\nAbu-Mostafa, Y. S. (1989).

It is a method of computing where the information traverses from the input layer to the output layer through hidden layers which are interconnected nodes. These nodes are inspired by the human brain and the way it interprets and learns information through signal transmission. \n",
